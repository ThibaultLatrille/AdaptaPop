	abstract = {The evolution of sexual dimorphism in quantitative characters under natural and sexual selection acting differently on the sexes is analyzed using population genetics models. The effects of genes when in males may be correlated with their effects when in females, producing correlated selective responses between the sexes, so that male and female phenotypes cannot evolve independently But under weak natural selection with constant relative fitnesses, in the absence of sexual selection, the joint evolution of the mean phenotypes of the sexes increases the mean fitness in a population, and if there is genetic variation for sexual dimorphism each sex eventually achieves a locally optimum phenotype. With sexual selection, fitnesses are generally frequency-dependent and evolution of the mean phenotypes does not maximize the mean fitness. Provided individual fitnesses exist, at equilibrium natural and sexual selection balance in each sex. A moderate intensity of sexual selection acting on a character under weak natural selection toward an intermediate optimum phenotype can produce a large deviation of the mean phenotype from the optimum and a substantial decrease of the mean fitness in a population, increasing the probability of extinction. When homologous characters in males and females vary similarly and are highly correlated genetically, the rate of evolution of sexual dimorphism may be one or more orders of magnitude slower than that for the average phenotype in a population. Methods for partitioning sexual dimorphism into contributions from natural and sexual selection are discussed, and genetic experiments are suggested for testing the involvement of non-equilibrium correlated selective responses between the sexes in observed cases of sexual dimorphism.},

	abstract = {The present paper is an attempt to provide a set of models which will be more useful in the analysis of macro-evolutionary events than the classical models of population genetics. This is accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems that in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations this can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of adaptive zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive topography for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive topography for gene frequencies. This shows that for most phenotypic characters under natural selection, the evolution of the average phenotype in a population is always toward an adaptive zone of high mean fitness (W̄) in the phenotype space. Frequency-dependent selection may cause the average phenotype to evolve away from its adaptive zone, decreasing the mean fitness of individuals in the population; different types of frequency-dependent selection are classified as to whether or not they lead to such maladaptive evolution. A simple formula for estimating the minimum selective mortality per generation necessary to explain observed rates of phenotypic evolution is derived (assuming that genetic drift was not involved). The minimum mortality rates needed to explain observed rates of evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary mammals are very small, typically about one selective death per million individuals per generation. This leads to consideration of the hypothesis that these changes were caused by random genetic drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the observed evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations, with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain. Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that if stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is not very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones may be an important mechanism of evolution in populations of effective size in the hundreds or thousands. These results support the contention that random genetic drift may play a significant role in phenotypic evolution.},

A number of studies have attributed differences in levels of polymorphism and divergence between silent and replacement mutations to the action of natural selection. Here, I investigate the statistical power to detect directional selection through contrasts of {DNA} variation among functional categories of mutations. A variety of statistical approaches are applied to {DNA} data simulated under Sawyer and Hartl\&\#039;s Poisson random field model. Under assumptions of free recombination and stationarity, comparisons that include both the frequency distributions of mutations segregating within populations and the numbers of mutations fixed between populations have substantial power to detect even very weak selection. Frequency distribution and divergence tests are applied to silent and replacement mutations among five alleles of each of eight Drosophila simulans genes. Putatively “preferred” silent mutations segregate at higher frequencies and are more often fixed between species than “unpreferred” silent changes, suggesting fitness differences among synonymous codons. Amino acid changes tend to be either rare polymorphisms or fixed differences, consistent with a combination of deleterious and adaptive protein evolution. In these data, a substantial fraction of both silent and replacement {DNA} mutations appear to affect fitness.},

	abstract = {An efficiency function is proposed that describes the effectiveness of a catalyst in accelerating a chemical reaction. This function depends on the rate constants for the reaction and has a limiting value of unity when the rate of the reaction is controlled by diffusive steps. The evolution of enzymes toward catalytic perfection can be quantified by this function. For the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde phosphate, the efficiency function has values of 2.5 × 10-11 for a simple carboxylate catalyst and 0.6 for the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase. Thus the enzyme is almost a perfect catalyst. The improvement in the catalytic efficiency of enzymes, compared with simple organic molecules, is separated into three broad types of alteration to the Gibbs free-energy profile. In order of increasing difficulty these are “uniform binding,” “differential binding,” and “catalysis of elementary steps.” For changes in “uniform binding,” the free energies of the bound states remain the same relative td each other but are altered with respect to those of unbound states. Changes in the “differential binding” are more subtle and require the enzyme to discriminate between different bound intermediates. Finally, the most sophisticated improvement involves “catalysis of an elementary step,” where an enzyme must discriminate between the transition state and the ground state of the kinetically significant step. These concepts are discussed for enzyme catalysis generally and are applied in particular to the reaction catalyzed by triosephosphate isomerase. © 1976, American Chemical Society.

Traits that affect rates ofmutation therefore also affect the phylogenetic "molecular clock." We consider the effects of sex-specific generation times and mutation rates in species with two sexes. In particular, we focus on the effects that the age of onset of male puberty and rates of spermatogenesis have likely had in hominids (great apes), considering a model that approximates features of the mutational process in mammals, birds, and some other vertebrates. As we show, this model can account for a number of seemingly disparate observations: notably, the puzzlingly low X-to-autosome ratios of substitution rates in humans and chimpanzees and differences in rates of autosomal substitutions among hominine lineages (i.e., humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas). The model further suggests how to translate pedigree-based estimates of human mutation rates into split times among extant hominoids (apes), given sex-specific life histories. In so doing, it largely bridges the gap reported between estimates of split times based on fossil and molecular evidence, in particular suggesting that the human- chimpanzee split may have occurred as recently as 6.6 Mya. The model also implies that the "generation time effect" should be stronger in short-lived species, explaining why the generation time has a major influence on yearly substitution rates in mammals but only a subtle one in human pedigrees.},

	abstract = {This review is motivated by the true explosion in the number of recent studies both developing and ameliorating probabilistic models of codon evolution. Traditionally parametric, the first codon models focused on estimating the effects of selective pressure on the protein via an explicit parameter in the maximum likelihood framework. Likelihood ratio tests of nested codon models armed the biologists with powerful tools, which provided unambiguous evidence for positive selection in real data. This, in turn, triggered a new wave of methodological developments. The new generation of models views the codon evolution process in a more sophisticated way, relaxing several mathematical assumptions. These models make a greater use of physicochemical amino acid properties, genetic code machinery, and the large amounts of data from the public domain. The overview of the most recent advances on modeling codon evolution is presented here, and a wide range of their applications to real data is discussed. On the downside, availability of a large variety of models, each accounting for various biological factors, increases the margin for misinterpretation; the biological meaning of certain parameters may vary among models, and model selection procedures also deserve greater attention. Solid understanding of the modeling assumptions and their applicability is essential for successful statistical data analysis. © The Author 2008.

Traditional approaches to study these properties have typically required the direct measurement of the property of interest, oftentimes a laborious undertaking. Although protein properties can be probed by mutagenesis, this approach has been limited by its low throughput. Recent technological developments have enabled the rapid quantification of a protein's function, such as binding to a ligand, for numerous variants of that protein. Here, we measure the ability of 47,000 variants of a {WW} domain to bind to a peptide ligand and use these functional measurements to identify stabilizing mutations without directly assaying stability. Our approach is rooted in the well-established concept that protein function is closely related to stability. Protein function is generally reduced by destabilizing mutations, but this decrease can be rescued by stabilizing mutations. Based on this observation, we introduce partner potentiation, a metric that uses this rescue ability to identify stabilizing mutations, and identify 15 candidate stabilizing mutations in the {WW} domain. We tested six candidates by thermal denaturation and found two highly stabilizing mutations, one more stabilizing than any previously known mutation. Thus, physicochemical properties such as stability are latent within these large-scale protein functional data and can be revealed by systematic analysis. This approach should allow other protein properties to be discovered.},

	abstract = {Despite intense work, incorporating constraints on protein native structures into the mathematical models of molecular evolution remains difficult, because most models and programs assume that protein sites evolve independently, whereas protein stability is maintained by interactions between sites. Here, we address this problem by developing a new mean-field substitution model that generates independent site-specific amino acid distributions with constraints on the stability of the native state against both unfolding and misfolding. The model depends on a background distribution of amino acids and one selection parameter that we fix maximizing the likelihood of the observed protein sequence. The analytic solution of the model shows that the main determinant of the site-specific distributions is the number of native contacts of the site and that the most variable sites are those with an intermediate number of native contacts. The mean-field models obtained, taking into account misfolded conformations, yield larger likelihood than models that only consider the native state, because their average hydrophobicity is more realistic, and they produce on the average stable sequences for most proteins. We evaluated the mean-field model with respect to empirical substitution models on 12 test data sets of different protein families. In all cases, the observed site-specific sequence profiles presented smaller Kullback–Leibler divergence from the mean-field distributions than from the empirical substitution model. Next, we obtained substitution rates combining the mean-field frequencies with an empirical substitution model. The resulting mean-field substitution model assigns larger likelihood than the empirical model to all studied families when we consider sequences with identity larger than 0.35, plausibly a condition that enforces conservation of the native structure across the family. We found that the mean-field model performs better than other structurally constrained models with similar or higher complexity. With respect to the much more complex model recently developed by Bordner and Mittelmann, which takes into account pairwise terms in the amino acid distributions and also optimizes the exchangeability matrix, our model performed worse for data with small sequence divergence but better for data with larger sequence divergence. The mean-field model has been implemented into the computer program Prot\_Evol that is freely available at http://ub.cbm.uam.es/software/Prot\_Evol.php.},

	abstract = {The computational reconstruction of ancestral proteins provides information on past biological events and has practical implications for biomedicine and biotechnology. Currently available tools for ancestral sequence reconstruction ({ASR}) are often based on empirical amino acid substitution models that assume that all sites evolve at the same rate and under the same process. However, this assumption is frequently violated because protein evolution is highly heterogeneous due to different selective constraints among sites. Here, we present {ProtASR}, a new evolutionary framework to infer ancestral protein sequences accounting for selection on protein stability. First, {ProtASR} generates site-specific substitution matrices through the structurally constrained mean-field ({MF}) substitution model, which considers both unfolding and misfolding stability. We previously showed that {MF} models outperform empirical amino acid substitution models, as well as other structurally constrained substitution models, both in terms of likelihood and correctly inferring amino acid distributions across sites. In the second step, {ProtASR} adapts a well-established maximum-likelihood ({ML}) {ASR} procedure to infer ancestral proteins under {MF} models. A known bias of {ML} {ASR} methods is that they tend to overestimate the stability of ancestral proteins by underestimating the frequency of deleterious mutations. We compared {ProtASR} under {MF} to two empirical substitution models ({JTT} and {CAT}), reconstructing the ancestral sequences of simulated proteins. {ProtASR} yields reconstructed proteins with less biased stabilities, which are significantly closer to those of the simulated proteins. Analysis of extant protein families suggests that folding stability evolves through time across protein families, potentially reflecting neutral fluctuation. Some families exhibit a more constant protein folding stability, while others are more variable. {ProtASR} is freely available from https://github.com/miguelarenas/protasr and includes detailed documentation and ready-to-use examples. It runs in seconds/minutes depending on protein length and alignment size.

	abstract = {The molecular clock, i.e., constancy of the rate of evolution over time, is commonly assumed in estimating divergence dates. However, this assumption is often violated and has drastic effects on date estimation. Recently, a number of attempts have been made to relax the clock assumption. One approach is to use maximum likelihood, which assigns rates to branches and allows the estimation of both rates and times. An alternative is the Bayes approach, which models the change of the rate over time. A number of models of rate change have been proposed. We have extended and evaluated models of rate evolution, i.e., the lognormal and its recent variant, along with the gamma, the exponential, and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. These models were first applied to a small hominoid data set, where an empirical Bayes approach was used to estimate the hyperparameters that measure the amount of rate variation. Estimation of divergence times was sensitive to these hyperparameters, especially when the assumed model is close to the clock assumption. The rate and date estimates varied little from model to model, although the posterior Bayes factor indicated the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process outperformed the other models. To demonstrate the importance of allowing for rate change across lineages, this general approach was used to analyze a larger data set consisting of the 18S ribosomal {RNA} gene of 39 metazoan species. We obtained date estimates consistent with paleontological records, the deepest split within the group being about 560 million years ago. Estimates of the rates were in accordance with the Cambrian explosion hypothesis and suggested some more recent lineage-specific bursts of evolution.},

Here we experimentally investigate this issue by introducing the same mutations into a set of diverged homologs of the influenza nucleoprotein and measuring the effects on stability. We find that mutational effects on stability are largely conserved across the homologs. We reach qualitatively similar conclusions when we simulate protein evolution with molecular-mechanics force fields. Our results do not mean that proteins evolve without epistasis, which can still arise even when mutational stability effects are conserved. However, our findings indicate that large evolutionary shifts in mutational effects on stability are rare, at least among homologs with similar structures and functions. We suggest that properly describing the clearly observable and highly conserved amino acid preferences at individual sites is likely to be far more important for phylogenetic analyses than accounting for rare shifts in amino acid propensities due to site covariation.},

One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays.

	abstract = {Despite being the second most species-rich and abundant group of mammals, bats are also among the least studied, with a particular paucity of information in the area of bat immunology. Although bats have a long history of association with rabies, the emergence and re-emergence of a number of viruses from bats that impact human and animal health has resulted in a resurgence of interest in bat immunology. Understanding how bats coexist with viruses in the absence of disease is essential if we are to begin to develop therapeutics to target viruses in humans and susceptible livestock and companion animals. Here, we review the current status of knowledge in the field of bat antiviral immunology including both adaptive and innate mechanisms of immune defence and highlight the need for further investigations in this area. Because data in this field are so limited, our discussion is based on both scientific discoveries and theoretical predictions. It is hoped that by provoking original, speculative or even controversial ideas or theories, this review may stimulate further research in this important field. Efforts to understand the immune systems of bats have been greatly facilitated in recent years by the availability of partial genome sequences from two species of bats, a megabat, Pteropus vampyrus, and a microbat, Myotis lucifugus, allowing the rapid identification of immune genes. Although bats appear to share most features of the immune system with other mammals, several studies have reported qualitative and quantitative differences in the immune responses of bats. These observations warrant further investigation to determine whether such differences are associated with the asymptomatic nature of viral infections in bats. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag {GmbH}.},

Physics sets the stage and the constraints that molecular evolution has to obey, and evolutionary theory helps in rationalizing the physical properties of biomolecules, including protein folding thermodynamics. To complete the parallelism, protein thermodynamics is founded on the statistical mechanics in the space of protein structures, and molecular evolution can be viewed as statistical mechanics in the space of protein sequences. In this review, we will integrate both points of view, applying them to detecting selection on the stability of the folded state of proteins. We will start discussing positive design, which strengthens the stability of the folded against the unfolded state of proteins. Positive design justifies why statistical potentials for protein folding can be obtained from the frequencies of structural motifs. Stability against unfolding is easier to achieve for longer proteins. On the contrary, negative design, which consists in destabilizing frequently formed misfolded conformations, is more difficult to achieve for longer proteins. The folding rate can be enhanced by strengthening short-range native interactions, but this requirement contrasts with negative design, and evolution has to trade-off between them. Finally, selection can accelerate functional movements by favoring low frequency normal modes of the dynamics of the native state that strongly correlate with the functional conformation change.},

	abstract = {In comparison with intense investigation of the structural determinants of protein folding rates, the sequence features favoring fast folding have received little attention. Here, we investigate this subject using simple models of protein folding and a statistical analysis of the Protein Data Bank ({PDB}). The mean-field model by Plotkin and coworkers predicts that the folding rate is accelerated by stronger-than-average interactions at short distance along the sequence. We confirmed this prediction using the Finkelstein model of protein folding, which accounts for realistic features of polymer entropy. We then tested this prediction on the {PDB}. We found that native interactions are strongest at contact range l = 8. However, since short range contacts tend to be exposed and they are frequently formed in misfolded structures, selection for folding stability tends to make them less attractive, that is, stability and kinetics may have contrasting requirements. Using a recently proposed model, we predicted the relationship between contact range and contact energy based on buriedness and contact frequency. Deviations from this prediction induce a positive correlation between contact range and contact energy, that is, short range contacts are stronger than expected, for 2/3 of the proteins. This correlation increases with the absolute contact order ({ACO}), as expected if proteins that tend to fold slowly due to large {ACO} are subject to stronger selection for sequence features favoring fast folding. Our results suggest that the selective pressure for fast folding is detectable only for one third of the proteins in the {PDB}, in particular those with large contact order. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, its huge dimensionality precludes understanding of even the basic aspects of its shape. One way to approach it is to ask a simpler question: what are the properties of a function that assigns fitness to each possible variant at just one particular site-a single position fitness landscape-and how does it change in the course of evolution? Analyses of genomic data from multiple species and multiple individuals within a species have proved beyond reasonable doubt that fitness functions of positions throughout the genome do themselves change with time, thus shaping protein evolution. Here, I will briefly review the literature that addresses these dynamics, focusing on recent genome-scale analyses of fitness functions of amino acid sites, i.e. vectors of fitnesses of 20 individual amino acid variants at a given position of a protein. The set of amino acids that confer high fitness at a particular position changes with time, and the rate of this change is comparable with the rate at which a position evolves, implying that this process plays a major role in evolutionary dynamics. However, the causes of these changes remain largely unclear.},

	abstract = {We present a new phylogenetic approach, selection on amino acids and codons ({SelAC}), whose substitution rates are based on a nested model linking protein expression to population genetics. Unlike simpler codon models that assume a single substitution matrix for all sites, our model more realistically represents the evolution of protein-coding {DNA} under the assumption of consistent, stabilizing selection using a cost-benefit approach. This cost–benefit approach allows us to generate a set of 20 optimal amino acid-specific matrix families using just a handful of parameters and naturally links the strength of stabilizing selection to protein synthesis levels, which we can estimate. Using a yeast data set of 100 orthologs for 6 taxa, we find {SelAC} fits the data much better than popular models by 104–105 Akike information criterion units adjusted for small sample bias. Our results also indicated that nested, mechanistic models better predict observed data patterns highlighting the improvement in biological realism in amino acid sequence evolution that our model provides. Additional parameters estimated by {SelAC} indicate that a large amount of nonphylogenetic, but biologically meaningful, information can be inferred from existing data. For example, {SelAC} prediction of gene-specific protein synthesis rates correlates well with both empirical (r=0.33–0.48) and other theoretical predictions (r=0.45–0.64) for multiple yeast species. {SelAC} also provides estimates of the optimal amino acid at each site. Finally, because {SelAC} is a nested approach based on clearly stated biological assumptions, future modifications, such as including shifts in the optimal amino acid sequence within or across lineages, are possible.},

	abstract = {The most common models of sequence evolution used to make inferences about adaptation rely on the assumption that selective pressures at a site remain constant through time. Instead, one might plausibly imagine that a change in the environment renders an allele beneficial and that when it fixes, the site is now constrained—until another change in the environment occurs that affects the selective pressures at that site. With this view in mind, we introduce a simple dynamic model for the evolution of coding regions, in which non-synonymous sites alternate between being fixed for the favored allele and being neutral with respect to other alleles. We use the pruning algorithm to derive closed forms for observable patterns of polymorphism and divergence in terms of the model parameters. Using our model, estimates of the fraction of beneficial substitutions α would remain similar to those obtained from existing approaches. In this framework, however, it becomes natural to ask how often adaptive substitutions originate from previously constrained or previously neutral sites, i.e., about the source of adaptive substitutions. We show that counts of coding sites that are both polymorphic in a sample from one species and divergent between two others carry information about this parameter. We also extend the basic model to include the effects of weakly deleterious mutations and discuss the importance of assumptions about the distribution of deleterious mutations among constrained non-synonymous sites. Finally, we derive a likelihood function for the parameters and apply it to a toy example, variation data for coding regions from chromosome 2 of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. This modeling work underscores how restrictive assumptions about adaptation have been to date, and how further work in this area will help to reveal unexplored and yet basic characteristics of adaptation.},

Using an exactly solvable lattice model, we design sequences with selected thermal properties. Compositional analysis of designed model sequences and natural proteomes reveals a specific trend in amino acid compositions in response to the requirement of stability at elevated environmental temperature: the increase of fractions of hydrophobic and charged amino acid residues at the expense of polar ones. We show that this "from both ends of the hydrophobicity scale" trend is due to positive (to stabilize the native state) and negative (to destabilize misfolded states) components of protein design. Negative design strengthens specific repulsive non-native interactions that appear in misfolded structures. A pressure to preserve specific repulsive interactions in non-native conformations may result in correlated mutations between amino acids that are far apart in the native state but may be in contact in misfolded conformations. Such correlated mutations are indeed found in {TIM} barrel and other proteins. © 2007 Berezovsky et al.},

We find that the rate of adaptive evolution is highest among amino acids that are more similar. This is partly due to the fact that the proportion of mutations that are adaptive is higher among more similar amino acids. We also find that the rate of neutral evolution between amino acids is higher among more similar amino acids.

	abstract = {A central aim of population genetics is the inference of the evolutionary history of a population. To this end, the underlying process can be represented by a model of the evolution of allele frequencies parametrized by e.g., the population size, mutation rates and selection coefficients. A large class of models use forward-in-time models, such as the discrete Wright-Fisher and Moran models and the continuous forward diffusion, to obtain distributions of population allele frequencies, conditional on an ancestral initial allele frequency distribution. Backward-in-time diffusion processes have been rarely used in the context of parameter inference. Here, we demonstrate how forward and backward diffusion processes can be combined to efficiently calculate the exact joint probability distribution of sample and population allele frequencies at all times in the past, for both discrete and continuous population genetics models. This procedure is analogous to the forward-backward algorithm of hidden Markov models. While the efficiency of discrete models is limited by the population size, for continuous models it suffices to expand the transition density in orthogonal polynomials of the order of the sample size to infer marginal likelihoods of population genetic parameters. Additionally, conditional allele trajectories and marginal likelihoods of samples from single populations or from multiple populations that split in the past can be obtained. The described approaches allow for efficient maximum likelihood inference of population genetic parameters in a wide variety of demographic scenarios.},

This task requires the integration of the several physical scales of biological organization, each defined by a distinct set of mechanisms and constraints, into a single unifying model. The molecular scale is dominated by the constraints imposed by the physico-chemical properties of proteins and their substrates, which give rise to trade-offs and epistatic (non-additive) effects of mutations. At the systems scale, biological networks modulate protein expression and can either buffer or enhance the fitness effects of mutations. The population scale is influenced by the mutational input, selection regimes, and stochastic changes affecting the size and structure of populations, which eventually determine the evolutionary fate of mutations. Here, we summarize the recent advances in theory, computer simulations, and experiments that advance our understanding of the links between various physical scales in biology.},

The {RAevol} model, a digital genetics model, provides us with an insight into the mechanisms involved in an evolutionary process. The results we present here show that (i) our model reproduces qualitatively these scaling laws and that (ii) these laws are not due to differences in lifestyles but to differences in the spontaneous rates of mutations and rearrangements.

Here we demonstrate that this definition of a site can give misleading results and that a physical definition of site should be used in some circumstances. We illustrate our point by reexamining the relationship between codon usage bias and the synonymous substitution rate. It has recently been shown that the rate of synonymous substitution, calculated using the Goldman-Yang method, which encapsulates the mutational-opportunity definition of a site at a high level of sophistication, is either positively correlated or uncorrelated to synonymous codon bias in Drosophila. Using other methods, which account for synonymous codon bias but define a site physically, we show that there is a negative correlation between the synonymous substitution rate and codon bias and that the lack of a negative correlation using the Goldman-Yang method is due to the way in which the number of synonymous sites is counted. We also show that there is a positive correlation between the synonymous substitution rate and third position {GC} content in mammals, but that the relationship is considerably weaker than that obtained using the Goldman-Yang method. We argue that the Goldman-Yang method is misleading in this context and conclude that methods that rely on a mutational-opportunity definition of a site should be used with caution.},

This translates into prediction that relative toxicity of extant proteins is higher for those evolving faster. In the present experiment, we selected pairs of yeast genes which were paralogous but evolving at different rates. We expressed them artificially to high levels. We expected that toxicity would be higher for ones bearing more mutations, especially that overcrowding should rather exacerbate than reverse the already existing differences in misfolding rates. We did find that the applied mode of overexpression caused a considerable decrease in fitness and that the decrease was proportional to the amount of excessive protein. However, it was not higher for proteins which are normally expressed at lower levels (and have less conserved sequence). This result was obtained consistently, regardless whether the rate of growth or ability to compete in common cultures was used as a proxy for fitness. In additional experiments, we applied factors that reduce accuracy of translation or enhance structural instability of proteins. It did not change a consistent pattern of independence between the fitness cost caused by overexpression of a protein and the rate of its sequence evolution.},

Inference methods may be tested with simulated data, producing full scenarios they can be compared with. But often simulations design is concomitant with the design of a particular method, developed by a same team, based on the same assumptions, when both should be blind to each other. In silico experimental evolution consists in evolving digital organisms with the aim of testing or discovering complex evolutionary processes. Models were not designed with a particular inference method in mind, only with basic biological principles. As such they provide a unique opportunity to blind test the behavior of inference methods. We give a proof of this concept on a comparative genomics problem: inferring the number of inversions separating two genomes. We use Aevol, an in silico experimental evolution platform, to produce benchmarks, and show that most combinatorial or statistical estimators of the number of inversions fail on this dataset while they were behaving perfectly on ad-hoc simulations. We argue that biological data is probably closer to the difficult situation.},

	abstract = {The fitness landscape defines the relationship between genotypes and fitness in a given environment and underlies fundamental quantities such as the distribution of selection coefficient and the magnitude and type of epistasis. A better understanding of variation in landscape structure across species and environments is thus necessary to understand and predict how populations will adapt. An increasing number of experiments investigate the properties of fitness landscapes by identifying mutations, constructing genotypes with combinations of these mutations, and measuring the fitness of these genotypes. Yet these empirical landscapes represent a very small sample of the vast space of all possible genotypes, and this sample is often biased by the protocol used to identify mutations. Here we develop a rigorous statistical framework based on Approximate Bayesian Computation to address these concerns and use this flexible framework to fit a broad class of phenotypic fitness models (including Fisher's model) to 26 empirical landscapes representing nine diverse biological systems. Despite uncertainty owing to the small size of most published empirical landscapes, the inferred landscapes have similar structure in similar biological systems. Surprisingly, goodness-of-fit tests reveal that this class of phenotypic models, which has been successful so far in interpreting experimental data, is a plausible in only three of nine biological systems. More precisely, although Fisher's model was able to explain several statistical properties of the landscapes—including the mean and {SD} of selection and epistasis coefficients—it was often unable to explain the full structure of fitness landscapes.},

We present a mathematical theory that predicts the number of accumulated mutations, the index of dispersion, and the distribution of stabilities in an evolving protein population from knowledge of the stability effects (ΔΔG values) for single mutations. Our theory quantitatively describes how neutral evolution leads to marginally stable proteins and provides formulas for calculating how fluctuations in stability can overdisperse the molecular clock. It also shows that the structural influences on the rate of sequence evolution observed in earlier simulations can be calculated using just the single-mutation ΔΔG values. We consider both the case when the product of the population size and mutation rate is small and the case when this product is large, and show that in the latter case the proteins evolve excess mutational robustness that is manifested by extra stability and an increase in the rate of sequence evolution. All our theoretical predictions are confirmed by simulations with lattice proteins. Our work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding how protein biophysics shapes the process of evolution.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses of molecular data require a quantitative model for how sequences evolve. Traditionally, the details of the site-specific selection that governs sequence evolution are not known a priori, making it challenging to create evolutionary models that adequately capture the heterogeneity of selection at different sites. However, recent advances in high-throughput experiments have made it possible to quantify the effects of all single mutations on gene function. I have previously shown that such high-throughput experiments can be combined with knowledge of underlying mutation rates to create a parameter-free evolutionary model that describes the phylogeny of influenza nucleoprotein far better than commonly used existing models. Here, I extend this work by showing that published experimental data on {TEM}-1 beta-lactamase (Firnberg E, Labonte {JW}, Gray {JJ}, Ostermeier M. 2014. A comprehensive, high-resolution map of a gene's fitness landscape. Mol Biol Evol. 31:1581-1592) can be combined with a few mutation rate parameters to create an evolutionary model that describes beta-lactamase phylogenies much better than most common existing models. This experimentally informed evolutionary model is superior even for homologs that are substantially diverged (about 35\% divergence at the protein level) from the {TEM}-1 parent that was the subject of the experimental study. These results suggest that experimental measurements can inform phylogenetic evolutionary models that are applicable to homologs that span a substantial range of sequence divergence.},

	abstract = {Sites of positive selection are identified by comparing observed evolutionary patterns to those expected under a null model for evolution in the absence of such selection. For protein-coding genes, the most common null model is that nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations fix at equal rates; this unrealistic model has limited power to detect many interesting forms of selection. I describe a new approach that uses a null model based on experimental measurements of a gene's site-specific amino-acid preferences generated by deep mutational scanning in the lab. This null model makes it possible to identify both diversifying selection for repeated amino-acid change and differential selection for mutations to amino acids that are unexpected given the measurements made in the lab. I show that this approach identifies sites of adaptive substitutions in four genes (lactamase, Gal4, influenza nucleoprotein, and influenza hemagglutinin) far better than a comparable method that simply compares the rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions. As rapid increases in biological data enable increasingly nuanced descriptions of the constraints on individual protein sites, approaches like the one here can improve our ability to identify many interesting forms of selection in natural sequences.

	abstract = {Background: The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that the efficacy of natural selection increases with the effective population size. This prediction has been verified by independent observations in diverse taxa, which show that life-history traits are strongly correlated with measures of the efficacy of selection, such as the {dN}/{dS} ratio. Surprisingly, avian taxa are an exception to this theory because correlations between life-history traits and {dN}/{dS} are apparently absent. Here we explore the role of {GC}-biased gene conversion on estimates of substitution rates as a potential driver of these unexpected observations. Results: We analyze the relationship between {dN}/{dS} estimated from alignments of 47 avian genomes and several proxies for effective population size. To distinguish the impact of {GC}-biased gene conversion from selection, we use an approach that accounts for non-stationary base composition and estimate {dN}/{dS} separately for changes affected or unaffected by {GC}-biased gene conversion. This analysis shows that the impact of {GC}-biased gene conversion on substitution rates can explain the lack of correlations between life-history traits and {dN}/{dS}. Strong correlations between life-history traits and {dN}/{dS} are recovered after accounting for {GC}-biased gene conversion. The correlations are robust to variation in base composition and genomic location. Conclusions: Our study shows that gene sequence evolution across a wide range of avian lineages meets the prediction of the nearly neutral theory, the efficacy of selection increases with effective population size. Moreover, our study illustrates that accounting for {GC}-biased gene conversion is important to correctly estimate the strength of selection.},

Recently, the multivariate neutral Moran model was proposed. However, it was shown insufficient to explain the distribution of alleles in great apes. Here, we propose a new model that includes allelic selection. Our theoretical results constitute the basis of a new Bayesian framework to estimate mutation rates and selection coefficients from population data. We apply the new framework to a great ape dataset, where we found patterns of allelic selection that match those of genome-wide {GC}-biased gene conversion ({gBGC}). In particular, we show that great apes have patterns of allelic selection that vary in intensity-a feature that we correlated with great apes' distinct demographies. We also demonstrate that the {AT}/{GC} toggling effect decreases the probability of a substitution, promoting more polymorphisms in the base composition of great ape genomes. We further assess the impact of {GC}-bias in molecular analysis, and find that mutation rates and genetic distances are estimated under bias when {gBGC} is not properly accounted for. Our results contribute to the discussion on the tempo and mode of {gBGC} evolution, while stressing the need for {gBGC}-aware models in population genetics and phylogenetics.},

Here we report the sequencing of polyadenylated {RNA} from six organs across ten species that represent all major mammalian lineages (placentals, marsupials and monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), with the goal of understanding the dynamics of mammalian transcriptome evolution. We show that the rate of gene expression evolution varies among organs, lineages and chromosomes, owing to differences in selective pressures: transcriptome change was slow in nervous tissues and rapid in testes, slower in rodents than in apes and monotremes, and rapid for the X chromosome right after its formation. Although gene expression evolution in mammals was strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous potentially selectively driven expression switches, which occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of various mammals.},

Major events in the subsequent history of the Lenz-Ising model are reviewed, including early approximate methods of solution, Onsager's exact result for the two-dimensional model, the use of the mathematically equivalent "lattice gas" model to study gas-liquid and liquid-solid phase transitions, and recent progress in determining the singularities of thermodynamic and magnetic properties at the critical point. Not only is there a wide range of possible physical applications of the model, there is also an urgent need for the application of advanced mathematical techniques in order to establish its exact properties, especially in the neighborhood of phase transitions where approximate methods are unreliable. © 1967 The American Physical Society.},

Nevertheless, considerable heterogeneity remains after correcting for G+C content. Synonymous substitution rates also vary among lineages, but the relative rates of genes are well conserved in different lineages. Certain genes have also been sequenced in a fourth order (lagomorph or carnivore), and these data have been used to investigate mammalian phylogeny. Data on lagomorphs are consistent with a star phylogeny, but there is evidence that carnivores and artiodactyls are sister groups.

The extent to which weak negative and positive darwinian selection have driven the molecular evolution of different species varies greatly, with some species, such as Drosophila melanogaster, showing strong evidence of pervasive positive selection, and others, such as the selfing weed Arabidopsis thaliana, showing an excess of deleterious variation within local populations. Here we contrast patterns of coding sequence polymorphism identified by direct sequencing of 39 humans for over 11,000 genes to divergence between humans and chimpanzees, and find strong evidence that natural selection has shaped the recent molecular evolution of our species. Our analysis discovered 304 (9.0\%) out of 3,377 potentially informative loci showing evidence of rapid amino acid evolution. Furthermore, 813 (13.5\%) out of 6,033 potentially informative loci show a paucity of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees, indicating weak negative selection and/or balancing selection operating on mutations at these loci. We find that the distribution of negatively and positively selected genes varies greatly among biological processes and molecular functions, and that some classes, such as transcription factors, show an excess of rapidly evolving genes, whereas others, such as cytoskeletal proteins, show an excess of genes with extensive amino acid polymorphism within humans and yet little amino acid divergence between humans and chimpanzees. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

We explain and develop a method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck ({OU}) process, first proposed by Hansen. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively different from, and more general than, pure drift models based on Brownian motion. Most importantly, {OU} models possess selective optima that formalize the notion of adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our approach allows us to translate hypotheses regarding adaptation in different selective regimes into explicit models, to test the models against data using maximum-likelihood-based model selection techniques, and to infer details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples. Relative to existing approaches, the direct modeling approach we demonstrate allows one to explore more detailed hypotheses and to utilize more of the information content of comparative data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a model selection framework to simultaneously compare a variety of hypotheses advances our ability to assess alternative evolutionary explanations.},

	abstract = {Levels of variability and rates of adaptive evolution may be affected by hitchhiking, the effect of selection on evolution at linked sites. Hitchhiking can be caused either by "selective sweeps" or by background selection, involving the spread of new favorable alleles or the elimination of deleterious mutations, respectively. Recent analyses of population genomic data have fitted models where both these processes act simultaneously, to infer the parameters of selection. Here, we investigate the consequences of relaxing a key assumption of some of these studies, that the time occupied by a selective sweep is negligible compared with the neutral coalescent time. We derive a new expression for the expected level of neutral variability in the presence of recurrent selective sweeps and background selection. We also derive approximate integral expressions for the effects of recurrent selective sweeps. The accuracy of the theoretical predictions was tested against multilocus simulations, with selection, recombination, and mutation parameters that are realistic for Drosophila melanogaster In the presence of crossing over, there is approximate agreement between the theoretical and simulation results. We show that the observed relationships between the rate of crossing over, and the level of synonymous site diversity and rate of adaptive evolution in Drosophila are probably mainly caused by background selection, whereas selective sweeps and population size changes are needed to produce the observed distortions of the site frequency spectrum.},

Even fewer studies have been carried out in groundwater organisms, although their evolution has long been considered to be particularly constrained by small Ne. In this study, we estimated the contemporary effective population size of the obligate groundwater isopod: Proasellus walteri (Chappuis, 1948). To this end, a genomic library was enriched for microsatellite motifs and sequenced using 454 {GS}-{FLX} technology. A total of 54,593 reads were assembled in 10,346 contigs or singlets, of which 245 contained candidate microsatellite sequences with suitable priming sites. Ninety-six loci were tested for amplification, polymorphism and multiplexing properties, of which seven were finally selected for Ne estimation. Linkage disequilibrium and approximate Bayesian computation methods revealed that Ne in this small interstitial groundwater isopod could reach large sizes ({\textbackslash}textgreater 585 individuals). Our results suggest that environmental conditions in groundwater, while often referred to as extreme, are not necessarily associated with small Ne. © 2013 Capderrey et al.},

This will require characterizing the nature of gene variation in human populations, assembling an extensive catalogue of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) in candidate genes and performing association studies for particular diseases. At present, our knowledge of human gene variation remains rudimentary. Here we describe a systematic survey of {SNPs} in the coding regions of human genes. We identified {SNPs} in 106 genes relevant to cardiovascular disease, endocrinology and neuropsychiatry by screening an average of 114 independent alleles using 2 independent screening methods. To ensure high accuracy, all reported {SNPs} were confirmed by {DNA} sequencing. We identified 560 {SNPs}, including 392 coding-region {SNPs} ({cSNPs}) divided roughly equally between those causing synonymous and non-synonymous changes. We observed different rates of polymorphism among classes of sites within genes (non-coding, degenerate and non-degenerate) as well as between genes. The {cSNPs} most likely to influence disease, those that alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, are found at a lower rate and with lower allele frequencies than silent substitutions. This likely reflects selection acting against deleterious alleles during human evolution. The lower allele frequency of missense {cSNPs} has implications for the compilation of a comprehensive catalogue, as well as for the subsequent application to disease association.},

The relationship is such that the proportion of effectively neutral nonsynonymous mutations increases by ∼45\% as Ne is halved. However, we also show that this relationship is steeper than expected from an independent estimate of the distribution of fitness effects from the site frequency spectrum. We investigate a number of potential explanations for this and show, using simulation, that this is consistent with a model of genetic hitchhiking: Genetic hitchhiking depresses diversity at neutral and weakly selected sites, but has little effect on the diversity of strongly selected sites.},

We use .9000 coding genes orthologous one-to-one across great apes, gibbons, and macaques to assess the stability of the {DFE} across great apes. We use the unfolded site frequency spectrum of polymorphic mutations (n = 8 haploid chromosomes per population) to estimate the {DFE}. We find that the shape of the deleterious {DFE} is strikingly similar across great apes. We confirm that effective population size (Ne) is a strong predictor of the strength of negative selection, consistent with the nearly neutral theory. However, we also find that the strength of negative selection varies more than expected given the differences in Ne between species. Across species, mean fitness effects of new deleterious mutations covaries with Ne, consistent with positive epistasis among deleterious mutations. We find that the strength of negative selection for the smallest populations, bonobos and western chimpanzees, is higher than expected given their Ne. This may result from a more efficient purging of strongly deleterious recessive variants in these populations. Forward simulations confirm that these findings are not artifacts of the way we are inferring Ne and {DFE} parameters. All findings are replicated using only {GC}-conservative mutations, thereby confirming that {GC}-biased gene conversion is not affecting our conclusions.},

This means that we can extend our vast knowledge of the human genome, its genes, and the associated phenotypes to these species. Comparative genomic studies of humans and apes thus reveal how very similar genomes react when exposed to different population genetic regimes. In this way, each species represents a natural experiment, where a genome highly similar to the human one, is differently exposed to the evolutionary forces of demography, population structure, selection, recombination, and admixture/hybridization. The initial sequencing of reference genomes for chimpanzee, orangutan, gorilla, the bonobo, each provided new insights and a second generation of sequencing projects has provided diversity data for all the great apes. In this chapter, we will outline some of the findings that population genomic analysis of great apes has provided, and how comparative studies have helped us understand how the fundamental forces in evolution have contributed to shaping the genomes and the genetic diversity of the great apes.},

Whether such trees are based on fossil or living specimens, they may often be criticized for having a subjective element. The purpose of this paper is to show how suitable evolutionary models can be constructed and applied objectively. In it we amplify and extend the methods we have given in previous communications (Ed-wards and Cavalli-Sforza, 1963a, b, 1964, 1965; Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards, 1964, 1966; Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1964; Cavalli-Sforza, 1966). Considering the great variety of information provided by living organisms, it is clear that the type of data will affect both the method of treatment and the validity of the results: the higher the correlation of data and genotype, the greater the validity is likely to be. Information on nucleic acid and protein structure comes first in the scale of relevance and that on phenotype measurements last; discrete and continuous variation demand different treatments, and evolutionary models appropriate to both cases will therefore be required for estimation purposes. Differences which are the result of mutation are formally discrete, and evolution at the molecular level thus needs discontinu-ous treatment; but even in this case the limit of observation may turn the data into the continuous type, as happens, for instance, when the similarity in nucleotide sequences in the nucleic acids of two organisms is measured by hybridization techniques or when differences between closely related organisms are examined. In the latter case, the differences may be sufficiently small to suggest that the analysis be carried out at the level of gene frequencies-semicontinuous variables which may be treated as continuous.

	abstract = {Genomic traits such as codon usage and the lengths of noncoding sequences may be subject to stabilizing selection rather than purifying selection. Mutations affecting these traits are often biased in one direction. To investigate the potential role of stabilizing selection on genomic traits, the effects of mutational bias on the equilibrium value of a trait under stabilizing selection in a finite population were investigated, using two different mutational models. Numerical results were generated using a matrix method for calculating the probability distribution of variant frequencies at sites affecting the trait, as well as by Monte Carlo simulations. Analytical approximations were also derived, which provided useful insights into the numerical results. A novel conclusion is that the scaled intensity of selection acting on individual variants is nearly independent of the effective population size over a wide range of parameter space and is strongly determined by the logarithm of the mutational bias parameter. This is true even when there is a very small departure of the mean from the optimum, as is usually the case. This implies that studies of the frequency spectra of {DNA} sequence variants may be unable to distinguish between stabilizing and purifying selection. A similar investigation of purifying selection against deleterious mutations was also carried out. Contrary to previous suggestions, the scaled intensity of purifying selection with synergistic fitness effects is sensitive to population size, which is inconsistent with the general lack of sensitivity of codon usage to effective population size. © 2013 by the Genetics Society of America.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the effects of selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation (‘ background selection') on rates of evolution and levels of genetic diversity at weakly selected, completely linked, loci. General formulae are derived for the expected rates of gene substitution and genetic diversity, relative to the neutral case, as a function of selection and dominance coefficients at the loci in question, and of the frequency of gametes that are free of deleterious mutations with respect to the loci responsible for background selection. As in the neutral case, most effects of background selection can be predicted by considering the effective size of the population to be multiplied by the frequency of mutation-free gametes. Levels of genetic diversity can be sharply reduced by background selection, with the result that values for sites under selection approach those for neutral variants subject to the same regime of background selection. Rates of fixation of slightly deleterious mutations are increased by background selection, and rates of fixation of advantageous mutations are reduced. The properties of sex-linked and autosomal asexual and self-fertilizing populations are considered. The implications of these results for the interpretation of studies of molecular evolution and variation are discussed. © 1994, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the absence of both positive and negative selections, coding sequences evolve at a neutral rate (R = 1). Such a high genomic rate is generally not achievable due to the prevalence of negative selection against codon substitutions. Remarkably, somatic evolution exhibits the seemingly neutral rate R ∼ 1 across normal and cancerous tissues. Nevertheless, R ∼ 1 may also mean that positive and negative selections are both strong, but equal in intensity. We refer to this regime as quasi-neutral. Indeed, individual genes in cancer cells often evolve at a much higher, or lower, rate than R ∼ 1. Here, we show that 1) quasi-neutrality is much more likely when populations are small (N {\textbackslash}textless 50); 2) stem-cell populations in single normal tissue niches, from which tumors likely emerge, have a small N (usually {\textbackslash}textless50) but selection at this stage is measurable and strong; 3) when N dips below 50, selection efficacy decreases precipitously; and 4) notably, N is smaller in the stem-cell niche of the small intestine than in the colon. Hence, the ∼70-fold higher rate of phenotypic evolution (observed as cancer risk) in the latter can be explained by the greater efficacy of selection, which then leads to the fixation of more advantageous and fewer deleterious mutations in colon cancers. In conclusion, quasi-neutral evolution sheds a new light on a general evolutionary principle that helps to explain aspects of cancer evolution.},

	abstract = {The Distribution of Fitness Effects ({DFE}) of new mutations is a key parameter of molecular evolution. The {DFE} can in principle be estimated by comparing the Site Frequency Spectra ({SFS}) of putatively neutral and functional polymorphisms. Unfortunately the {DFE} is intrinsically hard to estimate, especially for beneficial mutations since these tend to be exceedingly rare. There is therefore a strong incentive to find out whether conditioning on properties of mutations that are independent of the {SFS} could provide additional information. In the present study, we developed a new measure based on {SIFT} scores. {SIFT} scores are assigned to nucleotide sites based on their level of conservation across a multi species alignment: the more conserved a site, the more likely mutations occurring at this site are deleterious and the lower the {SIFT} score. If one knows the ancestral state at a given site, one can assign a value to new mutations occurring at the site based on the change of {SIFT} score associated with the mutation. We called this new measure δ. We show that properties of the {DFE} as well as the flux of beneficial mutations across classes covary with δ and, hence, that {SIFT} scores are informative when estimating the fitness effect of new mutations. In particular, conditioning on {SIFT} scores can help to characterize beneficial mutations.},

Although these questions have started to be tackled in animals, they have not been addressed to the same extent in plants. Here, we estimated nucleotide diversity at synonymous, πS, and nonsynonymous sites, πN, and a measure of the efficacy of selection, the ratio πN/πS, in 34 animal and 28 plant species using full genome data. We then evaluated the relationship of nucleotide diversity and selection efficacy with effective population size, the distribution of fitness effect and life history traits. In animals, our data confirm that longevity and propagule size are the variables that best explain the variation in πS among species. In plants longevity also plays a major role as well as mating system. As predicted by the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the log of πN/πS decreased linearly with the log of πS but the slope was weaker in plants than in animals. This appears to be due to a higher mutation rate in long lived plants, and the difference disappears when πS is rescaled by the mutation rate. Differences in the distribution of fitness effect of new mutations also contributed to variation in πN/πS among species.},

	abstract = {There is great variation in the rates of sequence evolution among proteins encoded by the same genome. The strongest correlate of evolutionary rate is expression level: highly expressed proteins tend to evolve slowly. This observation has led to the proposal that a major determinant of protein evolutionary rate involves the toxic effects of protein that misfolds due to transcriptional and translational errors (the mistranslation-induced misfolding [{MIM}] hypothesis). Here, I present a model that explains the correlation of evolutionary rate and expression level by selection for function. The basis of this model is that selection keeps expression levels near optima that reflect a trade-off between beneficial effects of the protein's function and some nonspecific cost of expression (e.g., the biochemical cost of synthesizing protein). Simulations confirm the predictions of the model. Like the {MIM} hypothesis, this model predicts several other relationships that are observed empirically. Although the model is based on selection for protein function, it is consistent with findings that a protein's rate of evolution is at most weakly correlated with its importance for fitness as measured by gene knockout experiments.},

	abstract = {The rate of nucleotide substitution is generally believed to be a decreasing function of effective population size, at least for nonsynonymous substitutions. This view was originally based on consideration of slightly deleterious mutations with a fixed distribution of selection coefficients. A realistic model must include the occurrence and fixation of some advantageous mutations that compensate for the loss of fitness due to deleterious substitutions. Some such models, such as so-called 'fixed' models, also predict a population size effect on substitution rate. An alternative model, presented here, predicts the near absence of a population size effect on substitution rate. This model is based on concave log-fitness functions and a fixed distribution of mutational effects on the selectively important trait. Simulations of an instance of the model confirm the approximate insensitivity of the substitution rate to population size. Although much experimental evidence has been claimed to support the existence of a population size effect, the body of evidence as a whole is equivocal, and much of the evidence that is supposed to demonstrate such an effect would also suggest that it is very small. Perhaps the proposed model applies well to some genes and not so well to others, and genes therefore vary with regard to the population size effect.},

These models are used to characterize the probabilities of amino acid substitution and enable better simulation of protein sequences over a phylogeny. A better characterization of amino acid substitution probabilities in turn enables numerous downstream applications, like detecting positive selection, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and evolutionarily-motivated protein engineering. Many existing Markov models for amino acid substitution in molecular evolution disregard molecular structure and describe the amino acid substitution process over longer evolutionary periods poorly. Here, we present a new model upgraded with a site-specific parameterization of pseudo-energy terms in a coarse-grained force field, which describes local heterogeneity in physical constraints on amino acid substitution better than a previous pseudo-energy-based model with minimum cost in runtime. The importance of each weight term parameterization in characterizing underlying features of the site, including contact number, solvent accessibility, and secondary structural elements was evaluated, returning both expected and biologically reasonable relationships between model parameters. This results in the acceptance of proposed amino acid substitutions that more closely resemble those observed site-specific frequencies in gene family alignments.

The ratio of the number of nucleotide substitutions in the rodent lineage to that in the human lineage since their divergence is 2.0 for synonymous substitutions and 1.3 for nonsynonymous substitutions. Rodents also evolve faster in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of five different {mRNAs}; the ratios are 2.6 and 3.1, respectively. The numbers of nucleotide substitutions between numbers of the β-globin gene family that were duplicated before the man-mouse split are also higher in mouse than in man. The difference is, again, greater for synonymous substitutions than for nonsynonymous substitutions. This tendency is more consistent with the neutralist view of molecular evolution than with the selectionist view. A simple explanation for the higher rates in rodents is that rodents have shorter generation times and, thus, higher mutation rates.

We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother–father–child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95\% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10−8 per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites.

Here, we discuss problems that arise when displaying branch values on trees after rerooting. Branch values are typically stored as node labels in the widely-used Newick tree format. However, such values are attributes of branches. Storing them as node labels can therefore yield errors when rerooting trees. This depends on the mostly implicit semantics that tools deploy to interpret node labels. We reviewed ten tree viewers and ten bioinformatics toolkits that can display and reroot trees. We found that 14 out of 20 of these tools do not permit users to select the semantics of node labels. Thus, unaware users might obtain incorrect results when rooting trees. We illustrate such incorrect mappings for several test cases and real examples taken from the literature. This review has already led to improvements in eight tools. We suggest tools should provide options that explicitly force users to define the semantics of node labels.},

	abstract = {The recent advancement in moving ‘biophysical' analysis of proteins in vivo has finally brought us to a position where we can start to make quantitative comparisons with existing in-vitro data. A striking observation is that protein behaviour in live cells seems, after all, not that different from in test tubes, not even at the level of complex mechanisms like protein aggregation. The example examined in this review is the {ALS} associated protein {SOD}1 that apparently retains its in-vitro properties in vivo. Does this mean that the protocols for studying proteins in vivo are somehow oversimplified, or that the macromolecular properties and interplay – despite being intrinsically malleable – are more evolutionary more ‘streamlined' than previously anticipated? Whatever the answer may be the time is now right to put these data to critical biological test.},

Thus, researchers have to rely on a growing number of increasingly complex software. All widely used core tools in the field have grown considerably, in terms of the number of features as well as lines of code and consequently, also with respect to software complexity. A topic that has received little attention is the software engineering quality of widely used core analysis tools. Software developers appear to rarely assess the quality of their code, and this can have potential negative consequences for end-users. To this end, we assessed the code quality of 16 highly cited and compute-intensive tools mainly written in C/C++ (e.g., {MrBayes}, {MAFFT}, {SweepFinder}, etc.) and {JAVA} ({BEAST}) from the broader area of evolutionary biology that are being routinely used in current data analysis pipelines. Because, the software engineering quality of the tools we analyzed is rather unsatisfying, we provide a list of best practices for improving the quality of existing tools and list techniques that can be deployed for developing reliable, high quality scientific software from scratch. Finally, we also discuss journal as well as science policy and, more importantly, funding issues that need to be addressed for improving software engineering quality as well as ensuring support for developing new and maintaining existing software. Our intention is to raise the awareness of the community regarding software engineering quality issues and to emphasize the substantial lack of funding for scientific software development.},

In protein evolution, there is strong support for the importance and prevalence of epistasis but the quantitative and relative contribution of various factors to epistasis are poorly known. Here, we determine the contribution of selection for folding stability to epistasis in protein evolution. By combining theoretical estimates of the rates of molecular evolution and the nonlinear mapping between protein folding thermodynamics and fitness, we show that the simple selection for folding stability imposes at least ∼30\% to ∼40\% epistasis in long-term protein evolution. Estimating the contribution of governing factors in molecular evolution such as protein folding stability to epistasis will provide a better understanding of epistasis that could improve methods in molecular evolution.},

Yet scans for positive selection rely on codon models which incorporate an assumption of effectively neutral synonymous substitution rate, constant between sites of each gene. Here we perform a large-scale comparison of approaches which incorporate codon substitution rate variation and propose our own simple yet effective modification of existing models. We find strong effects of substitution rate variation on positive selection inference. More than 70\% of the genes detected by the classical branch-site model are presumably false positives caused by the incorrect assumption of uniform synonymous substitution rate. We propose a new model which is strongly favored by the data while remaining computationally tractable. With the new model we can capture signatures of nucleotide level selection acting on translation initiation and on splicing sites within the coding region. Finally, we show that rate variation is highest in the highly recombining regions, and we propose that recombination and mutation rate variation, such as high {CpG} mutation rate, are the two main sources of nucleotide rate variation. Although we detect fewer genes under positive selection in Drosophila than without rate variation, the genes which we detect contain a stronger signal of adaptation of dynein, which could be associated with Wolbachia infection. We provide software to perform positive selection analysis using the new model.},

	abstract = {Likelihood-based approaches can reconstruct evolutionary processes in greater detail and with better precision from larger data sets. The extremely large comparative genomic data sets that are now being generated thus create new opportunities for understanding molecular evolution, but analysis of such large quantities of data poses escalating computational challenges. Recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that augment substitution histories are a promising approach to alleviate these computational costs. We analyzed the computational costs of several such approaches, considering how they scale with model and data set complexity. This provided a theoretical framework to understand the most important computational bottlenecks, leading us to combine novel variations of our conditional pathway integration approach with recent advances made by others. The resulting technique ("partial sampling" of substitution histories) is considerably faster than all other approaches we considered. It is accurate, simple to implement, and scales exceptionally well with dimensions of model complexity and data set size. In particular, the time complexity of sampling unobserved substitution histories using the new method is much faster than previously existing methods, and model parameter and branch length updates are independent of data set size. We compared the performance of methods on a 224-taxon set of mammalian cytochrome-b sequences. For a simple nucleotide substitution model, partial sampling was at least 10 times faster than the {PhyloBayes} program, which samples substitutions in continuous time, and about 100 times faster than when using fully integrated substitution histories. Under a general reversible model of amino acid substitution, the partial sampling method was 1,600 times faster than when using fully integrated substitution histories, confirming significantly improved scaling with model state-space complexity. Partial sampling of substitutions thus dramatically improves the utility of likelihood approaches for analyzing complex evolutionary processes on large data sets.},

The analysis of selection in this type of genetic data is broadly performed with the metric nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio ({dN}/{dS}). However, most of the well-established methodologies to estimate this metric make crucial assumptions, such as lack of recombination or invariable codon frequencies along genes, which can bias the estimation. Here, we review the most relevant biases in the {dN}/{dS} estimation and provide a detailed guide to estimate this metric using state-of-the-art procedures that account for such biases, along with illustrative practical examples and recommendations. We also discuss the traditional interpretation of the estimated {dN}/{dS} emphasizing the importance of considering complementary biological information such as the role of the observed substitutions on the stability and function of proteins.

We hypothesize that proteins in the interaction network act as evolutionary capacitors which allows their binding partners to explore regions of the sequence space which correspond to less stable proteins. In the interaction network of baker's yeast, we find that statistically proteins that receive higher energetic benefits from the interaction network are more likely to misfold. A simplified fitness landscape wherein the fitness of an organism is inversely proportional to the total concentration of unfolded proteins provides an evolutionary justification for the proposed trends. We conclude by outlining clear biophysical experiments to test our predictions.},

It hence provides an efficient solution to sample preprocessed markers adapted to user-specific needs. {OrthoMaM} has proven to be a valuable resource for researchers interested in mammalian phylogenomics, evolutionary genomics, and has served as a source of benchmark empirical data sets in several methodological studies. {OrthoMaM} is available for browsing, query and complete or filtered downloads at http://www.orthomam.univ-montp2.fr/. © The Author 2014.},

Information is now available to calculate this rate for several {DNA}-based haploid microbes, including bacteriophages with single- or double-stranded {DNA}, a bacterium, a yeast, and a filamentous fungus. Their genome sizes vary by ≃6500-fold. Their average mutation rates per base pair vary by ≃16,000-fold, whereas their mutation rates per genome vary by only ≃2.5-fold, apparently randomly, around a mean value of 0.0033 per {DNA} replication. The average mutation rate per base pair is inversely proportional to genome size. Therefore, a nearly invariant microbial mutation rate appears to have evolved. Because this rate is uniform in such diverse organisms, it is likely to be determined by deep general forces, perhaps by a balance between the usually deleterious effects of mutation and the physiological costs of further reducing mutation rates.},

	abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution. © 2006 Drummond et al.},

Here, we carry out the first combined analysis of seven predictors (gene expression level, dispensability, protein abundance, codon adaptation index, gene length, number of protein-protein interactions, and the gene's centrality in the interaction network) previously reported to have independent influences on protein evolutionary rates. Strikingly, our analysis reveals a single dominant variable linked to the number of translation events which explains 40-fold more variation in evolutionary rate than any other, suggesting that protein evolutionary rate has a single major determinant among the seven predictors. The dominant variable explains nearly half the variation in the rate of synonymous and protein evolution. We show that the two most commonly used methods to disentangle the determinants of evolutionary rate, partial correlation analysis and ordinary multivariate regression, produce misleading or spurious results when applied to noisy biological data. We overcome these difficulties by employing principal component regression, a multivariate regression of evolutionary rate against the principal components of the predictor variables. Our results support the hypothesis that translational selection governs the rate of synonymous and protein sequence evolution in yeast.},

	abstract = {Much recent work has explored molecular and population-genetic constraints on the rate of protein sequence evolution. The best predictor of evolutionary rate is expression level, for reasons that have remained unexplained. Here, we hypothesize that selection to reduce the burden of protein misfolding will favor protein sequences with increased robustness to translational missense errors. Pressure for translational robustness increases with expression level and constrains sequence evolution. Using several sequenced yeast genomes, global expression and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to an ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding effects and show that expression level explains roughly half the variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates. We examine causes for expression's dominant role and find that genome-wide tests favor the translational robustness explanation over existing hypotheses that invoke constraints on function or translational efficiency. Our results suggest that proteins evolve at rates largely unrelated to their functions and can explain why highly expressed proteins evolve slowly across the tree of life. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA}.},

Here, we demonstrate conserved patterns of simple covariation between sequence evolution, codon usage, and {mRNA} level in E. coli, yeast, worm, fly, mouse, and human that suggest that all observed trends stem largely from a unified underlying selective pressure. In metazoans, these trends are strongest in tissues composed of neurons, whose structure and lifetime confer extreme sensitivity to protein misfolding. We propose, and demonstrate using a molecular-level evolutionary simulation, that selection against toxicity of misfolded proteins generated by ribosome errors suffices to create all of the observed covariation. The mechanistic model of molecular evolution that emerges yields testable biochemical predictions, calls into question the use of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratios (Ka/Ks) to detect functional selection, and suggests how mistranslation may contribute to neurodegenerative disease. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Background: An excess of nonsynonymous substitutions, over neutrality, is considered evidence of positive Darwinian selection. Inference for proteins often relies on estimation of the nonsynonymous to synonymous ratio (\$ømega\$ = d N/d S) within a codon model. However, to ease computational difficulties, \$ømega\$ is typically estimated assuming an idealized substitution process where (i) all nonsynonymous substitutions have the same rate (regardless of impact on organism fitness) and (ii) instantaneous double and triple ({DT}) nucleotide mutations have zero probability (despite evidence that they can occur). It follows that estimates of \$ømega\$ represent an imperfect summary of the intensity of selection, and that tests based on the \$ømega\$ {\textbackslash}textgreater 1 threshold could be negatively impacted. Results: We developed a general-purpose parametric ({GPP}) modelling framework for codons. This novel approach allows specification of all possible instantaneous codon substitutions, including multiple nonsynonymous rates ({MNRs}) and instantaneous {DT} nucleotide changes. Existing codon models are specified as special cases of the {GPP} model. We use {GPP} models to implement likelihood ratio tests for \$ømega\$ {\textbackslash}textgreater 1 that accommodate {MNRs} and {DT} mutations. Through both simulation and real data analysis, we find that failure to model {MNRs} and {DT} mutations reduces power in some cases and inflates false positives in others. False positives under traditional M2a and M8 models were very sensitive to {DT} changes. This was exacerbated by the choice of frequency parameterization ({GY} vs. {MG}), with rates sometimes {\textbackslash}textgreater 90\% under {MG}. By including {MNRs} and {DT} mutations, accuracy and power was greatly improved under the {GPP} framework. However, we also find that over-parameterized models can perform less well, and this can contribute to degraded performance of {LRTs}. Conclusions: We suggest {GPP} models should be used alongside traditional codon models. Further, all codon models should be deployed within an experimental design that includes (i) assessing robustness to model assumptions, and (ii) investigation of non-standard behaviour of {MLEs}. As the goal of every analysis is to avoid false conclusions, more work is needed on model selection methods that consider both the increase in fit engendered by a model parameter and the degree to which that parameter is affected by un-modelled evolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {Recombination is typically thought of as a symmetrical process resulting in large-scale reciprocal genetic exchanges between homologous chromosomes. Recombination events, however, are also accompanied by short-scale, unidirectional exchanges known as gene conversion in the neighborhood of the initiating double-strand break. A large body of evidence suggests that gene conversion is {GC}-biased in many eukaryotes, including mammals and human. {AT}/{GC} heterozygotes produce more {GC}- than {AT}-gametes, thus conferring a population advantage to {GC}-alleles in high-recombining regions. This apparently unimportant feature of our molecular machinery has major evolutionary consequences. Structurally, {GC}-biased gene conversion explains the spatial distribution of {GC}-content in mammalian genomes - the so-called isochore structure. Functionally, {GC}-biased gene conversion promotes the segregation and fixation of deleterious {AT} → {GC} mutations, thus increasing our genomic mutation load. Here we review the recent evidence for a {GC}-biased gene conversion process in mammals, and its consequences for genomic landscapes, molecular evolution, and human functional genomics.

For this purpose; we analyzed 2,400 human/rodent and 834 mouse/rat orthologous genes, and we measured (using expressed sequence tag data) their expression patterns in 19 tissues from three development states. We show that substitution rates at nonsynonymous sites are strongly negatively correlated with tissue distribution breadth: almost threefold lower in ubiquitous than in tissue-specific genes. Nonsynonymous substitution rates also vary considerably according to the tissues: the average rate is twofold lower in brain-, muscle-, retina- and neuron-specific genes than in lymphocyte-, lung- , and liver-specific genes. Interestingly, 5' and 3' untranslated regions ({UTRs}) show exactly the same trend. These results demonstrate that the expression pattern is an essential factor in determining the selective pressure on functional sites in both coding and noncoding regions. Conversely, silent substitution rates do not vary with expression pattern, even in ubiquitously expressed genes. This latter result thus suggests that synonymous codon usage is not constrained by selection in mammals. Furthermore, this result also indicates that there is no reduction of mutation rates in genes expressed in the germ line, contrary to what had been hypothesized based on the fact that transcribed {DNA} is more efficiently repaired than nontranscribed {DNA}.},

This provides direct evidence for selection on silent sites in those three distantly related multicellular eukaryotes. Surprisingly, there is a strong negative correlation between codon usage and protein length. This effect is not due to a smaller size of highly expressed proteins. Thus, for a same-expression pattern, the selective pressure on codon usage appears to be lower in genes encoding long rather than short proteins. This puzzling observation is not predicted by any of the current models of selection on codon usage and thus raises the question of how translation efficiency affects fitness in multicellular organisms.},

	abstract = {The neutral theory of molecular evolution states that most mutations are deleterious or neutral. It results that the evolutionary rate of a given position in an alignment is a function of the level of constraint acting on this position. Inferring evolutionary rates from a set of aligned sequences is hence a powerful method to detect functionally and/or structurally important positions in a protein. Some positions, however, may be constrained while having a high substitution rate, providing these substitutions do not affect the biochemical property under constraint. Here, I introduce a new evolutionary rate measure accounting for the evolution of specific biochemical properties (e.g., volume, polarity, and charge). I then present a new statistical method based on the comparison of two rate measures: a site is said to be constrained for property X if it shows an unexpectedly high conservation of X knowing its total evolutionary rate. Compared to single-rate methods, the two-rate method offers several advantages: it (i) allows assessment of the significance of the constraint, (ii) provides information on the type of constraint acting on each position, and (iii) detects positions that are not proposed by previous methods. I apply this method to a 200-sequence data set of triosephosphate isomerase and report significant cases of positions constrained for polarity, volume, or charge. The three-dimensional localization of these positions shows that they are of potential interest to the molecular evolutionist and to the biochemist. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC}.},

	abstract = {Background. Accurately modeling the sequence substitution process is required for the correct estimation of evolutionary parameters, be they phylogenetic relationships, substitution rates or ancestral states; it is also crucial to simulate realistic data sets. Such simulation procedures are needed to estimate the null-distribution of complex statistics, an approach referred to as parametric bootstrapping, and are also used to test the quality of phylogenetic reconstruction programs. It has often been observed that homologous sequences can vary widely in their nucleotide or amino-acid compositions, revealing that sequence evolution has changed importantly among lineages, and may therefore be most appropriately approached through non-homogeneous models. Several programs implementing such models have been developed, but they are limited in their possibilities: only a few particular models are available for likelihood optimization, and data sets cannot be easily generated using the resulting estimated parameters. Results. We hereby present a general implementation of non-homogeneous models of substitutions. It is available as dedicated classes in the Bio++ libraries and can hence be used in any C++ program. Two programs that use these classes are also presented. The first one, Bio++ Maximum Likelihood ({BppML}), estimates parameters of any non-homogeneous model and the second one, Bio++ Sequence Generator ({BppSeqGen}), simulates the evolution of sequences from these models. These programs allow the user to describe non-homogeneous models through a property file with a simple yet powerful syntax, without any programming required. Conclusion. We show that the general implementation introduced here can accommodate virtually any type of non-homogeneous models of sequence evolution, including heterotachous ones, while being computer efficient. We furthermore illustrate the use of such general models for parametric bootstrapping, using tests of non-homogeneity applied to an already published ribosomal {RNA} data set. © 2008 Dutheil and Boussau; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

Several Plasmodium-protective alleles have recently evolved in human populations, but little is known about host adaptation to blood parasites over deeper evolutionary timescales. In this work, we analyze mammalian adaptation in ∼500 Plasmodium- or Piroplasm- interacting proteins ({PPIPs}) manually curated from the scientific literature. We show that (i) {PPIPs} are enriched for both immune functions and pleiotropy with other pathogens, and (ii) the rate of adaptation across mammals is significantly elevated in {PPIPs}, compared to carefully matched control proteins. {PPIPs} with high pathogen pleiotropy show the strongest signatures of adaptation, but this pattern is fully explained by their immune enrichment. Several pieces of evidence suggest that blood parasites specifically have imposed selection on {PPIPs}. First, even non-immune {PPIPs} that lack interactions with other pathogens have adapted at twice the rate of matched controls. Second, {PPIP} adaptation is linked to high expression in the liver, a critical organ in the parasite life cycle. Finally, our detailed investigation of alpha-spectrin, a major red blood cell membrane protein, shows that residues with particularly high rates of adaptation are those known to interact specifically with P. falciparum. Overall, we show that host proteins that interact with Plasmodium and Piroplasm parasites have experienced elevated rates of adaptation across mammals, and provide evidence that some of this adaptation has likely been driven by blood parasites.},

It is generally accepted that proteins must be able to fold stably in order to function. However, the relationship between stability constraints and among-sites rate variation is not well understood. Here, we present a biophysical model that links the thermodynamic stability changes due to mutations at sites in proteins () to the rate at which mutations accumulate at those sites over evolutionary time. We find that such a ‘stability model' generally performs well, displaying correlations between predicted and empirically observed rates of up to 0.75 for some proteins. We further find that our model has comparable predictive power as does an alternative, recently proposed ‘stress model' that explains evolutionary-rate variation among sites in terms of the excess energy needed for mutants to adopt the correct active structure (). The two models make distinct predictions, though, and for some proteins the stability model outperforms the stress model and vice versa.

There is evidence of significant variation in the levels of divergence between presumably neutral regions, pointing at an underlying variation in the rate of mutation across the genome. Apparently, such variation occurs on different scales, including sequence context effects (the influence of neighboring nucleotides on the rate of mutation at individual sites), variation within chromosomes (on the scales of kilobases as well as megabases), and between chromosomes (among autosomes as well as between autosomes and sex chromosomes). An important aspect for further research in this area is to study whether there is an ultimate evolutionary explanation for mutation rate variation within mammalian genomes.},

	abstract = {How much does the intensity of purifying selection vary among populations and species? How uniform are the shifts in selective pressures across the genome? To address these questions, we took advantage of a recent, whole-genome polymorphism data set from two closely related species of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. paradoxus, paying close attention to the population structure within these species. We found that the average intensity of purifying selection on amino acid sites varies markedly among populations and between species. As expected in the presence of extensive weakly deleterious mutations, the effect of purifying selection is substantially weaker on single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) segregating within populations than on {SNPs} fixed between population samples. Also in accordance with a Nearly Neutral model, the variation in the intensity of purifying selection across populations corresponds almost perfectly to simple measures of their effective size. As a first step toward understanding the processes generating these patterns, we sought to tease apart the relative importance of systematic, genome-wide changes in the efficacy of selection, such as those expected from demographic processes and of gene-specific changes, which may be expected after a shift in selective pressures. For that purpose, we developed a new model for the evolution of purifying selection between populations and inferred its parameters from the genome-wide data using a likelihood approach. We found that most, but not all changes seem to be explained by systematic shifts in the efficacy of selection. One population, the sake-derived strains of S. cerevisiae, however, also shows extensive gene-specific changes, plausibly associated with domestication. These findings have important implications for our understanding of purifying selection as well as for estimates of the rate of molecular adaptation in yeast and in other species. © 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

In groundwaters, large geographic ranges of presumably good dispersers are increasingly suspected to consist of assemblages of cryptic species with narrow ranges. Moreover, a large species range, even when confirmed by molecular evidence, tells us little about the spatiotemporal dynamics of dispersal. Here, we used phylogenetic inferences, species delineation methods and Bayesian phylogeographic diffusion models to test for the likelihood of postglacial colonization from distant refugia among five morphospecies of Proasellus (Isopoda, Asellidae). All morphospecies except one were monophyletic, but they comprised a total of 15-17 cryptic species. Three cryptic species retained ranges that spanned a distance {\textbackslash}textgreater650 km, similar to that of the nominal morphospecies. Bayesian diffusion models based on mitochondrial markers revealed considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in dispersal rates, suggesting that short-time dispersal windows were instrumental in shaping species ranges. Only one species was found to experience a recent, presumably postglacial, range expansion. The Jura and Alpine foothills probably played a major role in maintaining diversity within Proasellus in northern regions by acting both as diversification hotspots and Pleistocene refugia. Gaining insight into the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of dispersal rates revealed contrasting colonization dynamics among species that were not consistent with a global postglacial colonization of Europe from distant refugia. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The role of positive selection in human evolution remains controversial. On the one hand, scans for positive selection have identified hundreds of candidate loci, and the genome-wide patterns of polymorphism show signatures consistent with frequent positive selection. On the other hand, recent studies have argued that many of the candidate loci are false positives and that most genome-wide signatures of adaptation are in fact due to reduction of neutral diversity by linked deleterious mutations, known as background selection. Here we analyze human polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project and detect signatures of positive selection once we correct for the effects of background selection. We show that levels of neutral polymorphism are lower near amino acid substitutions, with the strongest reduction observed specifically near functionally consequential amino acid substitutions. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions are associated with signatures of recent adaptation that should not be generated by background selection, such as unusually long and frequent haplotypes and specific distortions in the site frequency spectrum. We use forward simulations to argue that the observed signatures require a high rate of strongly adaptive substitutions near amino acid changes. We further demonstrate that the observed signatures of positive selection correlate better with the presence of regulatory sequences, as predicted by the {ENCODE} Project Consortium, than with the positions of amino acid substitutions. Our results suggest that adaptation was frequent in human evolution and provide support for the hypothesis of King and Wilson that adaptive divergence is primarily driven by regulatory changes. © 2014 Enard et al.},

We apply the method to extensively sampled single-nucleotide polymorphism data from humans and estimate the distribution of fitness effects for amino acid changing mutations.

This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions, and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method.

A comparison of the A/S ratio of polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster with that of divergence from Drosophila simulans shows that the A/S ratio of divergence is twice as high—a difference that is often attributed to positive selection. But an increase in selective constraint owing to an increase in effective population size could also explain this observation, and, if so, all genes should be affected similarly. Here we show that the difference between polymorphism and divergence is limited to only a fraction of the genes, which are also evolving more rapidly, and this implies that positive selection is responsible. A higher A/S ratio of divergence than of polymorphism is also observed in other species, which suggests a rate of adaptive evolution that is far higher than permitted by the neutral theory of molecular evolution.},

	abstract = {The method of Hidden Markov Models is used to allow for unequal and unknown evolutionary rates at different sites in molecular sequences. Rates of evolution at different sites are assumed to be drawn from a set of possible rates, with a finite number of possibilities. The overall likelihood of phylogeny is calculated as a sum of terms, each term being the probability of the data given a particular assignment of rates to sites, times the prior probability of that particular combination of rates. The probabilities of different rate combinations are specified by a stationary Markov chain that assigns rate categories to sites. While there will be a very large number of possible ways of assigning rates to sites, a simple recursive algorithm allows the contributions to the likelihood from all possible combinations of rates to be summed, in a time proportional to the number of different rates at a single site. Thus with three rates, the effort involved is no greater than three times that for a single rate. This 'Hidden Markov Model' method allows for rates to differ between sites and for correlations between the rates of neighboring sites. By summing over all possibilities it does not require us to know the rates at individual sites. However, it does not allow for correlation of rates at nonadjacent sites, nor does it allow for a continuous distribution of rates over sites. It is shown how to use the Newton-Raphson method to estimate branch lengths of a phylogeny and to infer from a phylogeny what assignment of rates to sites has the largest posterior probability. An example is given using β-hemoglobin {DNA} sequences in eight mammal species; the regions of high and low evolutionary rates are inferred and also the average length of patches of similar rates.},

	abstract = {The boundaries between prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes and multicellular eukaryotes are accompanied by orders-of-magnitude reductions in effective population size, with concurrent amplifications of the effects of random genetic drift and mutation. The resultant decline in the efficiency of selection seems to be sufficient to influence a wide range of attributes at the genomic level in a non-adaptive manner. A key remaining question concerns the extent to which variation in the power of random genetic drift is capable of influencing phylogenetic diversity at the subcellular and cellular levels. Should this be the case, population size would have to be considered as a potential determinant of the mechanistic pathways underlying long-term phenotypic evolution. Here we demonstrate a phylogenetically broad inverse relation between the power of drift and the structural integrity of protein subunits. This leads to the hypothesis that the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations in populations of small size induces secondary selection for proteing-protein interactions that stabilize key gene functions. By this means, the complex protein architectures and interactions essential to the genesis of phenotypic diversity may initially emerge by non-adaptive mechanisms. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Reconstructing ancestral characters on a phylogeny is an arduous task because the observed states at the tips of the tree correspond to a single realization of the underlying evolutionary process. Recently, it was proposed that ancestral traits can be indirectly estimated with the help of molecular data, based on the fact that life history traits influence substitution rates. Here we challenge these new approaches in the Cetartiodactyla, a clade of large mammals which, according to paleontology, derive from small ancestors. Analysing transcriptome data in 41 species, of which 22 were newly sequenced, we provide a dated phylogeny of the Cetartiodactyla and report a significant effect of body mass on the overall substitution rate, the synonymous vs. non-synonymous substitution rate and the dynamics of {GC}-content. Our molecular comparative analysis points toward relatively small Cetartiodactyla ancestors, in agreement with the fossil record, even though our data set almost exclusively consists of large species. This analysis demonstrates the potential of phylogenomic methods for ancestral trait reconstruction and gives credit to recent suggestions that the ancestor to placental mammals was a relatively large and long-lived animal.; {DA}},

	abstract = {Mammalian and avian genomes are characterized by a substantial spatial heterogeneity of {GC}-content, which is often interpreted as reflecting the effect of local {GC}-biased gene conversion ({gBGC}), a meiotic repair bias that favors G and C over A and T alleles in high-recombining genomic regions. Surprisingly, the first fully sequenced nonavian sauropsid (i.e., reptile), the green anole Anolis carolinensis, revealed a highly homogeneous genomic {GC}-content landscape, suggesting the possibility that {gBGC} might not be at work in this lineage. Here, we analyze {GC}-content evolution at third-codon positions ({GC}3) in 44 vertebrates species, including eight newly sequenced transcriptomes, with a specific focus on nonavian sauropsids. We report that reptiles, including the green anole, have a genome-wide distribution of {GC}3 similar to that of mammals and birds, and we infer a strong {GC}3-heterogeneity to be already present in the tetrapod ancestor. We further show that the dynamic of coding sequence {GC}-content is largely governed by karyotypic features in vertebrates, notably in the green anole, in agreement with the {gBGC} hypothesis. The discrepancy between third-codon positions and noncoding {DNA} regarding {GC}-content dynamics in the green anole could not be explained by the activity of transposable elements or selection on codon usage. This analysis highlights the unique value of third-codon positions as an insertion/deletion-free marker of nucleotide substitution biases that ultimately affect the evolution of proteins.},

The analysis of nonsynonymous ({dN}) versus synonymous ({dS}) substitution rates in birds versus mammals, however, has provided contradictory results, questioning the generality of the nearly neutral theory. Here we analyzed the impact of life history traits, taken as proxies of the effective population size, on molecular evolutionary and population genetic processes in amniotes, including the so far neglected reptiles. We report a strong effect of species body mass, longevity, and age of sexual maturity on genome-wide patterns of polymorphism and divergence across the major groups of amniotes, in agreement with the nearly neutral theory. Our results indicate that the rate of protein evolution in amniotes is determined in the first place by the efficiency of purifying selection against deleterious mutations-and this is true of both radical and conservative amino acid changes. Interestingly, the among-species distribution of {dN}/{dS} in birds did not follow this general trend: {dN}/{dS} was not higher in large, long-lived than in small, short-lived species of birds. We show that this unexpected pattern is not due to a more narrow range of life history traits, a lack of correlation between traits and Ne, or a peculiar distribution of fitness effects of mutations in birds. Our analysis therefore highlights the bird {dN}/{dS} ratio as a molecular evolutionary paradox and a challenge for future research.},

We quantify the distribution of fitness effects of synonymous mutations and show that it is dominated by many mutations of small or no effect and few mutations of larger effect. We then compare the shape of the codon fitness landscape across amino acid positions and environments, and quantify how the consideration of synonymous fitness effects changes the evolutionary dynamics on these fitness landscapes.

Although these properties are inherently quantitative, structure-based studies of protein evolution tend to rely upon coarse distinctions between “surface” and “buried” residues and between “interfacial” and “noninterfacial” residues. Using homology-mapped yeast protein structures, we explore the relationships between residue evolution and continuous structural properties of the residue microenvironment, including solvent accessibility, density and distribution of residue–residue contacts, and burial depth. We confirm the role of solvent exposure as a major structural determinant of residue evolution and also identify a weak secondary effect arising from packing density. The relationship between solvent exposure and evolutionary rate ({dN}/{dS}) is found to be strong, positive, and linear. This reinforces the notion that residue burial is a continuous property with quantitative fitness implications. Next, we demonstrate systematic variation in residue-level structure–evolution relationships resulting from changes in global physical and biological contexts. We find that increasing protein-core size yields a more rapid relaxation of selective constraint as solvent exposure increases, although solvent-excluded residues remain similarly constrained. Finally, we analyze the selective constraint in protein–protein interfaces, revealing two fundamentally different yet separable components: continuous structural constraint that scales with total residue burial and a more surprising fixed functional constraint that accompanies any degree of interface involvement. These discoveries serve to elucidate and unite structure–evolution relationships at the residue and whole-protein levels.},

Sequences contributing to species adaptation are expected to evolve faster than nonfunctional sequences because favourable mutations have a higher fixation probability than neutral ones. Such an accelerated rate of evolution might be due to factors other than natural selection, in particular {GC}-biased gene conversion. This is true of neutral sequences, but also of constrained sequences, which can be illustrated using the mouse Fxy gene. Several criteria can discriminate between the natural selection and biased gene conversion models. These criteria suggest that the recently reported human accelerated regions are most likely the result of biased gene conversion.

The impact of drift on genome diversity and evolution is known to vary among species, but quantifying this effect is a difficult task. Here we assess the magnitude of variation in drift power among species of animals via its effect on the mutation load - which implies to jointly infer the distribution of fitness effects of deleterious mutations ({DFE}). To this aim, we analyze the non-synonymous (amino-acid changing) and synonymous (amino-acid conservative) allele frequency distributions in a large sample of metazoan species, with a focus on the primates vs. fruit flies contrast. We show that a Gamma model of the {DFE} is not suitable due to strong differences in estimated shape parameters among taxa, while adding a class of lethal mutations essentially solves the problem. Using the Gamma + lethal model and assuming that the mean deleterious effects of non-synonymous mutations is shared among species, we estimate that the power of drift varies by a factor of at least 500 between large-Ne and small-Ne species of animals, i.e., an order of magnitude more than the among-species variation in genetic diversity. Our results therefore contribute to addressing Lewontin\&\#039;s paradox, while further questioning the meaning of the Ne parameter in population genomics.},

We show that the accrual of mutations should track cell divisions not only when mutations are replicative in origin but also when they are non-replicative and repaired efficiently. One implication is that observations from diverse fields that to date have been interpreted as pointing to a replicative origin of most mutations could instead reflect the accumulation of mutations arising from endogenous reactions or exogenous mutagens. We further find that only mutations that arise from inefficiently repaired lesions will accrue according to absolute time; thus, unless life history traits co-vary, the phylogenetic “molecular clock” should not be expected to run steadily across species.},

However, the very beginnings of bioinformatics occurred more than 50 years ago, when desktop computers were still a hypothesis and {DNA} could not yet be sequenced. The foundations of bioinformatics were laid in the early 1960s with the application of computational methods to protein sequence analysis (notably, de novo sequence assembly, biological sequence databases and substitution models). Later on, {DNA} analysis also emerged due to parallel advances in (i) molecular biology methods, which allowed easier manipulation of {DNA}, as well as its sequencing, and (ii) computer science, which saw the rise of increasingly miniaturized and more powerful computers, as well as novel software better suited to handle bioinformatics tasks. In the 1990s through the 2000s, major improvements in sequencing technology, along with reduced costs, gave rise to an exponential increase of data. The arrival of ‘Big Data' has laid out new challenges in terms of data mining and management, calling for more expertise from computer science into the field. Coupled with an ever-increasing amount of bioinformatics tools, biological Big Data had (and continues to have) profound implications on the predictive power and reproducibility of bioinformatics results. To overcome this issue, universities are now fully integrating this discipline into the curriculum of biology students. Recent subdisciplines such as synthetic biology, systems biology and whole-cell modeling have emerged from the ever-increasing complementarity between computer science and biology.},

	abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution Markov random field ({MRF}) equivalence, this assignment also determines an {MRF} image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the {MRF}. For a range of degradation mechanisms including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an {MRF} with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (“annealing”) or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel “relaxation” algorithm for {MAP} estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios. © 1984, {IEEE}.},

	abstract = {Patterns of genetic differentiation among taxa at early stages of divergence provide an opportunity to make inferences about the history of speciation. Here, we conduct a survey of {DNA}-sequence polymorphism and divergence at loci on the autosomes, X chromosome, Y chromosome and mitochondrial {DNA} in samples of Mus domesticus, M. musculus and M. castaneus. We analyzed our data under a divergence with gene flow model and estimate that the effective population size of M. castaneus is 200 000-400 000, of M. domesticus is 100 000-200 000 and of M. musculus is 60 000-120 000. These data also suggest that these species started to diverge approximately 500 000 years ago. Consistent with this recent divergence, we observed considerable variation in the genealogical patterns among loci. For some loci, all alleles within each species formed a monophyletic group, while at other loci, species were intermingled on the phylogeny of alleles. This intermingling probably reflects both incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow after divergence. Likelihood ratio tests rejected a strict allopatric model with no gene flow in comparisons between each pair of species. Gene flow was asymmetric: no gene flow was detected into M. domesticus, while significant gene flow was detected into both M. castaneus and M. musculus. Finally, most of the gene flow occurred at autosomal loci, resulting in a significantly higher ratio of fixed differences to polymorphisms at the X and Y chromosomes relative to autosomes in some comparisons, or just the X chromosome in others, emphasizing the important role of the sex chromosomes in general and the X chromosome in particular in speciation. © 2008 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Proteins evolve within complex biophysical constraints. Natural selection promotes the survival of the fittest organisms. Therefore, protein variants that decrease organismal fitness are likely to go extinct along with the strains that bare them. However selection is not destiny and the stringency of selection is not infinite. Rather, it is tuned by the number of organisms in an evolving population. Counteracting selection is the pressure of random mutations and luck; evolution is stochastic, and the fittest organisms do not always survive and reproduce. Randomly arising mutations can affect proteins in numerous ways. They can destabilize them, abolish catalytic activity, or change their intracellular abundance, and each of these can have a profound effect on fitness. Selection for stability is the most pervasive biophysical evolutionary pressure on globular proteins because these proteins are inactive and may form toxic aggregates when unfolded. In this dissertation, we examine the role of selection for folding stability in the pace of protein structure evolution. We find that the rate of structure evolution with respect to sequence divergence is slower for stable proteins than for their unstable counterparts. This observation can be explained with a simple analytical model that treats structure evolution as an activated process. We carried out simulations of model proteins to test the assumptions of the model and examine the mechanisms of protein structure evolution. Next, we lifted the assumption that evolution occurred under stability selection. Instead, protein data was visualized directly to interrogate the functional constrains under which proteins evolve. The overall strength of these constraints was manifested in the rate of protein sequence evolution, a quantity that can be calculated from genomic data. To facilitate interactive interrogation of the dataset, based on the yeast and E. coli proteomes, we developed a data visualization tool called {ProteomeVis}. Using this tool, users can observe correlations among protein properties and their sequence evolution rates as well as compare the sequences and structures of proteins in each proteome. We conceive of {ProteomeVis} as a versatile hypothesis generator that users can use as a launching point for further investigation.},

	abstract = {Much evidence indicates that {GC}-biased gene conversion ({gBGC}) has a major impact on the evolution of mammalian ge- nomes. However, a detailed quantification of the process is still lacking. The strength of {gBGC} can be measured from the analysis of derived allele frequency spectra ({DAF}), but this approach is sensitive to a number of confounding factors. In particular, we show by simulations that the inference is pervasively affected by polymorphism polarization errors and by spatial heterogeneity in {gBGC} strength. We propose a new general method to quantify {gBGC} from {DAF} spectra, incorpo- rating polarization errors, taking spatial heterogeneity into account, and jointly estimating mutation bias. Applying it to human polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that the strength of {gBGC} does not differ between hypermutable {CpG} sites and non-{CpG} sites, suggesting that in humans {gBGC} is not caused by the base-excision repair ma- chinery. Genome-wide, the intensity of {gBGC} is in the nearly neutral area. However, given that recombination occurs pri- marily within recombination hotspots, 1\%–2\% of the human genome is subject to strong {gBGC}. On average, {gBGC} is stronger in African than in non-African populations, reflecting differences in effective population sizes. However, due to more heterogeneous recombination landscapes, the fraction of the genome affected by strong {gBGC} is larger in non- African than in African populations. Given that the location of recombination hotspots evolves very rapidly, our analysis predicts},

Negative selection and genetic drift may dominate the first phase, whereas positive selection may become much more significant in the second phase. However, the conventional dichotomy of synonymous vs. nonsynonymous changes does not offer the resolution needed to study the dynamics of these two phases. Following previously published methods, we separated amino acid changes into 75 elementary types (1-bp substitution between their respective codons). The likelihood of each type of amino acid change becoming polymorphic ({PI}, which stands for "polymorphic index"), relative to synonymous changes, can then be calculated. Similarly, the likelihood of fixation ({FI}, for "fixation index"), conditional on common polymorphisms, is also calculated. Using Perlegen and {HapMap} data on human polymorphisms and the chimpanzee sequences as the outgroup, we compared the evolutionary dynamics of the 75 elementary changes in the two phases. We found a strong "L-shaped" negative correlation (P {\textbackslash}textless0.001) between {FI} and {PI}. Only those changes with low {PIs} show {FI} {\textbackslash}textgreater1, which is often a signature of adaptive evolution. These patterns suggest that negative and positive selection operate more effectively on the same set of amino acid changes and that approximately 10-13\% of amino acid substitutions between humans and chimpanzee may be adaptive.},

Parametric bootstrap tests indicate that the solvent accessibility status of a site has a particularly strong association with the process of amino acid replacement that it experiences. Significant association between secondary structure environment and the amino acid replacement process is also observed. Careful description of the length distribution of secondary structure elements and of the organization of secondary structure and solvent accessibility along a protein did not always significantly improve the fit of the evolutionary models to the data sets that were analyzed. As indicated by the strength of the association of both solvent accessibility and secondary structure with amino acid replacement, the process of protein evolution—both above and below the species level—will not be well understood until the physical constraints that affect protein evolution are identified and characterized.},

	abstract = {When we seek to explain the characteristics of living systems in their evolutionary context, we are often interested in understanding how and why certain properties arose through evolution, and how these properties then affected the continuing evolutionary process. This endeavor has been assisted by the use of simple computational models that have properties characteristic of natural living systems but allow simulations over evolutionary timescales with full transparency. We examine a model of the evolution of a gene under selective pressure to code for a protein that exists in a prespecified folded state at a given growth temperature. We observe the emergence of proteins with modest stabilities far below those possible with the model, with a denaturation temperature tracking the simulation temperature, despite the absence of selective pressure for such marginal stability. This demonstrates that neither observations of marginally stable proteins, nor even instances where increased stability interferes with function, provide evidence that marginal stability is an adaptation. Instead the marginal stability is the result of a balance between predominantly destabilizing mutations and selection that shifts depending on effective population size. Even if marginal stability is not an adaptation, the natural tendency of proteins toward marginal stability, and the range of stabilities that occur during evolution, may have significant effect on the evolutionary process. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

However, epistatic interactions among sites in a protein result in hererogeneities in the substitution rate, both temporal and spatial, that are beyond the capabilities of current models. Here we use parallels between amino acid substitutions and chemical reaction kinetics to develop an improved theory of protein evolution. We constructed a mechanistic framework for modelling amino acid substitution rates that uses the formalisms of statistical mechanics, with principles of population genetics underlying the analysis. Theoretical analyses and computer simulations of proteins under purifying selection for thermodynamic stability show that substitution rates and the stabilization of resident amino acids (the ‘evolutionary Stokes shift') can be predicted from biophysics and the effect of sequence entropy alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that substitutions predominantly occur when epistatic interactions result in near neutrality; substitution rates are determined by how often epistasis results in such nearly neutral conditions. This theory provides a general framework for modelling protein sequence change under purifying selection, potentially explains patterns of convergence and mutation rates in real proteins that are incompatible with previous models, and provides a better null model for the detection of adaptive changes. Simulations of protein evolution under purifying selection for thermodynamic stability show that amino-acid substitution rates can be predicted from biophysical dynamics and epistatic interactions that result in near neutrality.},

Current estimates suggest that whereas Drosophila, mice, and bacteria have undergone extensive adaptive evolution, hominids show little or no evidence of adaptive evolution in protein-coding sequences. This may be a consequence of differences in effective population size. To study the matter further, we have investigated whether plants show evidence of adaptive evolution using an extension of the {McDonald}-Kreitman test that explicitly models slightly deleterious mutations by estimating the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations. We apply this method to data from nine pairs of species. Altogether more than 2,400 loci with an average length of 280 nucleotides were analyzed. We observe very similar results in all species; we find little evidence of adaptive amino acid substitution in any comparison except sunflowers. This may be because many plant species have modest effective population sizes. © The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.

Here, we test whether the effective population size varies across the genome, between protein-coding genes, in 10 eukaryotic species by considering whether there is significant variation in neutral diversity, taking into account differences in the mutation rate between loci by using the divergence between species. In most species we find significant evidence of variation. We investigate whether the variation in Ne is correlated to recombination rate and the density of selected sites in four species, for which these data are available. We find that Ne is positively correlated to recombination rate in one species, Drosophila melanogaster, and negatively correlated to a measure of the density of selected sites in two others, humans and Arabidopsis thaliana. However, much of the variation remains unexplained. We use a hierarchical Bayesian analysis to quantify the amount of variation in the effective population size and show that it is quite modest in all species-most genes have an Ne that is within a few fold of all other genes. Nonetheless we show that this modest variation in Ne is sufficient to cause significant differences in the efficiency of natural selection across the genome, by demonstrating that the ratio of the number of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms is significantly correlated to synonymous diversity and estimates of Ne, even taking into account the obvious nonindependence between these measures. © 2011 by the Genetics Society of America.},

	abstract = {The understanding of selective constraints affecting genes is a major issue in biology. It is well established that gene expression level is a major determinant of the rate of protein evolution, but the reasons for this relationship remain highly debated. Here we demonstrate that gene expression is also a major determinant of the evolution of gene dosage: the rate of gene losses after whole genome duplications in the Paramecium lineage is negatively correlated to the level of gene expression, and this relationship is not a byproduct of other factors known to affect the fate of gene duplicates. This indicates that changes in gene dosage are generally more deleterious for highly expressed genes. This rule also holds for other taxa: in yeast, we find a clear relationship between gene expression level and the fitness impact of reduction in gene dosage. To explain these observations, we propose a model based on the fact that the optimal expression level of a gene corresponds to a trade-off between the benefit and cost of its expression. This {COSTEX} model predicts that selective pressure against mutations changing gene expression level or affecting the encoded protein should on average be stronger in highly expressed genes and hence that both the frequency of gene loss and the rate of protein evolution should correlate negatively with gene expression. Thus, the {COSTEX} model provides a simple and common explanation for the general relationship observed between the level of gene expression and the different facets of gene evolution. © 2010 Guelfo et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Antagonistic host-pathogen co-evolution is a determining factor in the outcome of infection and shapes genetic diversity at the population level of both partners. Little is known about the overall genomic rate of evolution in pathogens or the molecular bases of rapid adaptation. Here we apply a population genomic approach to infer genome-wide patterns of selection among thirteen isolates of the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Results: Based on whole genome alignments, we report extensive presence-absence polymorphisms of genes resulting from a high extent of within population karyotypic variation. We apply different test statistics based on the distribution of non-synonymous and synonymous polymorphisms ({pN}/{pS}) and substitutions ({dN}/{dS}) to estimate rates of adaptation and identify specific targets of selection. We report that the {pN}/{pS} ratio of sites under purifying selection negatively correlates with the local recombination rate, as expected under a scenario of background selection. Contrasting polymorphism and divergence with a closely related species, we estimate that 44\% of substitutions in the proteome of Z. tritici are adaptive and we find that the rate of adaptation is positively correlated with recombination rate. The proportion of adaptive amino acid substitutions in genes encoding determinants of pathogenicity is as high as 68\% underlining the importance of positive selection in the evolution of virulence-associated traits. Using a maximum likelihood approach and codon models of sequence evolution, we furthermore identify a set of 786 additional genes showing signatures of diversifying selection, which we find are preferentially located in region of high recombination rates. Conclusions: We report a high rate of adaptive mutations in the genome of Z. tritici, in particular in genes involved in host-pathogen interactions. Furthermore, we identify a set of genes with signature of balancing / diversifying selection, which we find are related to secondary metabolism and host infection. Finally, we report a strong impact of recombination on the efficacy of purifying, adaptive and diversifying selection, suggesting pervasive effect of linked selection in the genome and thereby highlighting the importance of recombination in this pathogen species.},

In particular, the ratio {ddNS} is expected to be a good proxy for x, the ratio of fixation probabilities of nonsynonymous mutations relative to that of neutral mutations. Standard methods for estimating {dN}, {dS}, or x rely on the assumption that the base composition of sequences is at the equilibrium of the evolutionary process. In many clades, this assumption of stationarity is in fact incorrect, and we show here through simulations and analyses of empirical data that nonstationarity biases the estimate of {dN}, {dS}, and x. We show that the bias in the estimate of x can be fixed by explicitly taking into consideration nonstationarity in the modeling of codon evolution, in a maximum likelihood framework. Moreover, we propose an exact method for estimating {dN} and {dS} on branches, based on stochastic mapping, that can take into account nonstationarity. This method can be directly applied to any kind of codon evolution model, as long as neutrality is clearly parameterized.},

Finally, we discuss protein evolution in the cell in light of current biophysical evidence. We describe the factors that drive protein evolution and shape protein interaction networks. These interactions can significantly affect the free energy, δG, of marginally stable and low-population proteins and, due to epistasis, direct the evolutionary pathways in an organism.

	abstract = {The relative contributions of neutral and adaptive substitutions to molecular evolution has been one of the most controversial issues in evolutionary biology for more than 40 years. The analysis of within-species nucleotide polymorphism and between-species divergence data supports a widespread role for adaptive protein evolution in certain taxa. For example, estimates of the proportion of adaptive amino acid substitutions (α) are 50\% or more in enteric bacteria and Drosophila. In contrast, recent estimates of α for hominids have been at most 13\%. Here, we estimate α for protein sequences of murid rodents based on nucleotide polymorphism data from multiple genes in a population of the house mouse subspecies Mus musculus castaneus, which inhabits the ancestral range of the Mus species complex and nucleotide divergence between M. m. castaneus and M. famulus or the rat. We estimate that 57\% of amino acid substitutions in murids have been driven by positive selection. Hominids, therefore, are exceptional in having low apparent levels of adaptive protein evolution. The high frequency of adaptive amino acid substitutions in wild mice is consistent with their large effective population size, leading to effective natural selection at the molecular level. Effective natural selection also manifests itself as a paucity of effectively neutral nonsynonymous mutations in M. m. castaneus compared to humans. © 2010 Halligan et al.},

Current modeling of selection via site-to- site rate heterogeneity generally neglects another aspect of selection, namely position-specific amino acid frequencies. These frequencies determine the maximum dissimilarity expected for highly diverged but functionally and structurally conserved sequences, and hence are crucial for estimating long distances. We introduce a codon-level model of coding sequence evolution in which position-specific amino acid frequencies are free parameters. In our implementation, these are estimated from an alignment using methods described previously. We use simulations to demonstrate the importance and feasibility of modeling such behavior; our model produces linear distance estimates over a wide range of distances, while several alternative models underestimate long distances relative to short distances. Site-to-site differences in rates, as well as synonymous/nonsynonymous and first/second/third-codon- position differences, arise as a natural consequence of the site-to-site differences in amino acid frequencies.},

In this Review, we first discuss the evidence for codon-dependent effects on translation, beginning with the basic mechanisms through which translation perturbation can affect translation efficiency, protein folding and transcript stability.

	abstract = {Many enzymes in intermediary metabolism manifest saturation kinetics in which flux is a concave function of enzyme activity and often of the Michaelis-Menten form. The result is that, when natural selection favors increased enzyme activity so as to maximize flux, a point of diminishing returns will be attained in which any increase in flux results in a disproportionately small increase in fitness. Enzyme activity ultimately will reach a level at which the favorable effect of an increase in activity is of the order 1/(4Ne) or smaller, where Ne is the effective population number. At this point, many mutations that result in small changes in activity will result in negligible changes in fitness and will be selectively nearly neutral. We propose that this process is a mechanism whereby conditions for the occurrence of nearly neutral mutations and gene substitutions can be brought about by the long-continued action of natural selection. Evidence for the hypothesis derives from metabolic theory, direct studies of flux, studies of null and other types of alleles in Drosophila melanogaster and chemostat studies in Escherichia coli. Limitations and complications of the theory include changes in environment or genetic background, enzymes with sharply defined optima of activity, overdominance, pleiotropy, multifunctional enzymes and branched metabolic pathways. We conclude that the theory is a useful synthesis that unites many seemingly unrelated observations. The principal theoretical conclusion is that the conditions for the occurrence of neutral evolution can be brought about as an indirect result of the action of natural selection.},

Although a slightly detrimental mutation is somewhat less likely to become fixed by chance than a slightly favorable mutation, mutations that are slightly detrimental might be expected to be more numerous than favorable mutations owing to the previous incorporation of favorable mutations by a long history of natural selection. The result is that, as Ohta has pointed out, a significant fraction of mutations that are fixed in evolution are slightly detrimental. In the long run, the fixation of detrimental mutations in a gene increases the opportunity for the occurrence of a compensatory favorable mutation, either in the same gene or in an interacting gene. On a suitably long timescale, therefore, every gene incorporates favorable mutations that compensate for detrimental mutations previously fixed. This form of evolution is driven primarily by natural selection, but it results in no change or permanent improvement in enzymatic function.},

Here we present a phylogeny of 18 bat species, each of which is represented in 1,107 orthologous gene alignments used to build the tree. We generated a transcriptome sequence of Hypsignathus monstrosus, the African hammer-headed bat, and additional transcriptome sequence for Rousettus aegyptiacus, the Egyptian fruit bat. We then combined these data with existing genomic and transcriptomic data from 16 other bat species. In the analysis of such datasets, there is no clear consensus on the most reliable computational methods for the curation of quality multiple sequence alignments since these public datasets represent multiple investigators and methods, including different source materials (chromosomal {DNA} or expressed {RNA}). Here we lay out a systematic analysis of parameters and produce an advanced pipeline for curating orthologous gene alignments from combined transcriptomic and genomic data, including a software package: The Mismatching Isoform {eXon} Remover ({MIXR}). Using this method, we created alignments of 11,677 bat genes, 1,107 of which contain orthologs from all 18 species. Using the orthologous gene alignments created, we assessed bat phylogeny and also performed a holistic analysis of positive selection acting in bat genomes. We found that 181 genes have been subject to positive natural selection. This list is dominated by genes involved in immune responses and genes involved in the production of collagens.},

Major advances in understanding fundamental principles underlying protein folding in optimized in vitro conditions have yielded detailed physicochemical principles of folding landscapes for small, single domain proteins. In addition, there has been increased research focusing on the key features of protein folding in the cell that differentiate it from in vitro folding, such as co-translational folding, chaperone-facilitated folding, and folding in crowded conditions with many weak interactions. Yet these two research areas have not been bridged effectively in research carried out to date. This review points to gaps between the two that are ripe for future research. Moreover, we emphasize the biological selection pressures that impact protein folding in vivo and how fitness drives the evolution of protein sequences in ways that may place foldability in tension with other requirements on a given protein. We suggest that viewing the physicochemical process of protein folding through the lens of evolution will unveil new insights and pose novel challenges about in-cell folding landscapes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Brownian models have been introduced in phylogenetics for describing variation in substitution rates through time, with applications to molecular dating or to the comparative analysis of variation in substitution patterns among lineages. Thus far, however, the Monte Carlo implementations of these models have relied on crude approximations, in which the Brownian process is sampled only at the internal nodes of the phylogeny or at the midpoints along each branch, and the unknown trajectory between these sampled points is summarized by simple branchwise average substitution rates. Results: A more accurate Monte Carlo approach is introduced, explicitly sampling a fine-grained discretization of the trajectory of the (potentially multivariate) Brownian process along the phylogeny. Generic Monte Carlo resampling algorithms are proposed for updating the Brownian paths along and across branches. Specific computational strategies are developed for efficient integration of the finite-time substitution probabilities across branches induced by the Brownian trajectory. The mixing properties and the computational complexity of the resulting Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler scale reasonably with the discretization level, allowing practical applications with up to a few hundred discretization points along the entire depth of the tree. The method can be generalized to other Markovian stochastic processes, making it possible to implement a wide range of time-dependent substitution models with well-controlled computational precision.},

	abstract = {Background: Protein sites evolve at different rates due to functional and biophysical constraints. It is usually considered that the main structural determinant of a site's rate of evolution is its Relative Solvent Accessibility ({RSA}). However, a recent comparative study has shown that the main structural determinant is the site's Local Packing Density ({LPD}). {LPD} is related with dynamical flexibility, which has also been shown to correlate with sequence variability. Our purpose is to investigate the mechanism that connects a site's {LPD} with its rate of evolution. Results: We consider two models: an empirical Flexibility Model and a mechanistic Stress Model. The Flexibility Model postulates a linear increase of site-specific rate of evolution with dynamical flexibility. The Stress Model, introduced here, models mutations as random perturbations of the protein's potential energy landscape, for which we use simple Elastic Network Models ({ENMs}). To account for natural selection we assume a single active conformation and use basic statistical physics to derive a linear relationship between site-specific evolutionary rates and the local stress of the mutant's active conformation.We compare both models on a large and diverse dataset of enzymes. In a protein-by-protein study we found that the Stress Model outperforms the Flexibility Model for most proteins. Pooling all proteins together we show that the Stress Model is strongly supported by the total weight of evidence. Moreover, it accounts for the observed nonlinear dependence of sequence variability on flexibility. Finally, when mutational stress is controlled for, there is very little remaining correlation between sequence variability and dynamical flexibility. Conclusions: We developed a mechanistic Stress Model of evolution according to which the rate of evolution of a site is predicted to depend linearly on the local mutational stress of the active conformation. Such local stress is proportional to {LPD}, so that this model explains the relationship between {LPD} and evolutionary rate. Moreover, the model also accounts for the nonlinear dependence between evolutionary rate and dynamical flexibility. © 2014 Huang et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {The molecular clock hypothesis remains an important conceptual and analytical tool in evolutionary biology despite the repeated observation that the clock hypothesis does not perfectly explain observed {DNA} sequence variation. We introduce a parametric model that relaxes the molecular clock by allowing rates to vary across lineages according to a compound Poisson process. Events of substitution rate change are placed onto a phylogenetic tree according to a Poisson process. When an event of substitution rate change occurs, the current rate of substitution is modified by a gamma-distributed random variable. Parameters of the model can be estimated using Bayesian inference. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo integration to evaluate the posterior probability distribution because the posterior probability involves high dimensional integrals and summations. Specifically, we use the Metropolis-Hastings-Green algorithm with 11 different move types to evaluate the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the method by analyzing a complete {mtDNA} sequence data set from 23 mammals. The model presented here has several potential advantages over other models that have been proposed to relax the clock because it is parametric and does not assume that rates change only at speciation events. This model should prove useful for estimating divergence times when substitution rates vary across lineages.},

High relative rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes (\$ømega\$ = {dNl} {dS}) are a clear indicator of positive, or directional, selection, and several recently developed methods attempt to distinguish these sites from those under neutral or purifying selection. One method uses an empirical Bayesian framework that accounts for varying selective pressures across sites while conditioning on the parameters of the model of {DNA} evolution and on the phylogenetic history. We describe a method that identifies sites under diversifying selection using a fully Bayesian framework. Similar to earlier work, the method presented here allows the rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes to vary among sites. The significant difference in using a fully Bayesian approach lies in our ability to account for uncertainty in parameters including the tree topology, branch lengths, and the codon model of {DNA} substitution. We demonstrate the utility of the fully Bayesian approach by applying our method to a data set of the vertebrate β-globin gene. Compared to a previous analysis of this data set, the hierarchical model found most of the same sites to be in the positive selection class, but with a few striking exceptions.},

	abstract = {The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that slightly deleterious mutations subject to purifying selection are widespread in natural populations, particularly those of large effective population size. To test this hypothesis, the standardized difference between pairwise nucleotide difference and number of segregation sites (corrected for number of sequences) was estimated for 149 population data sets from 84 species of bacteria. This quantity (Tajima's D-statistic) was estimated separately for synonymous (D syn) and nonsynonymous (Dnon) polymorphisms. D syn was positive in 70\% of data sets, and the overall median D syn (0.873) was positive. By contrast Dnon was negative in 68\% of data sets, and the overall median Dnon (-0.656) was negative. The preponderance of negative values of Dnon is evidence that there are widespread rare nonsynonymous polymorphisms in the process of being eliminated by purifying selection, as predicted to occur in populations with large effective size by the nearly neutral theory. The major exceptions to this trend were seen among surface proteins, particularly those of bacteria parasitic on vertebrates, which included a number of cases of polymorphisms apparently maintained by balancing selection.

We have addressed this issue by analysing the molecular evolution of 108 non-essential and 67 essential genes that have been sequenced in both mouse and rat. On preliminary analysis, the non-essential genes appeared to be faster evolving than the essential ones. We found, however, that the non-essential class contains a disproportionate number of immune-system genes that may be under directional selection (that is, selection favouring change) because of host-parasite coevolution. After correction for this bias, we found that the rate at which genes evolve does not correlate with the severity of the knockout phenotype. This was corroborated by the finding that, whereas neuron-specific genes have significantly lower rates of change than other genes, essential and non-essential neuronal genes have comparable rates of evolution. Our findings most probably reflect strong selection acting against even very subtle deleterious phenotypes, and indicate that the putative involvement of directional selection in host-parasite coevolution and gene expression within the nervous system explains much more of the variance in rates of gene evolution than does the knockout phenotype.},

Here, by producing and sequencing a comprehensive collection of 10,000 mutants, we explore the mutational landscape of one enzyme involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance, the beta-lactamase {TEM}-1. We measured mutation impact on the enzyme activity through the estimation of amoxicillin minimum inhibitory concentration on a subset of 990 mutants carrying a unique missense mutation, representing 64\% of possible amino acid changes in that protein reachable by point mutation. We established that mutation type, solvent accessibility of residues, and the predicted effect of mutations on protein stability primarily determined alone or in combination changes in minimum inhibitory concentration of mutants. Moreover, we were able to capture the drastic modification of the mutational landscape induced by a single stabilizing point mutation (M182T) by a simple model of protein stability. This work thereby provides an integrated framework to study mutation effects and a tool to understand/define better the epistatic interactions.},

These interfaces are larger than between molecules in protein crystals, and smaller than between subunits in oligomeric proteins. We relate the size and chemical nature of interfaces in complexes to the thermodynamical parameters that characterize affinity: the heat capacity and free enthalpy (Gibbs energy) of dissociation at equilibrium, the activation free enthalpy for the dissociation reaction. The same structural and thermodynamical parameters are inadequate for representing the specificity of recognition.

Yet, attempts at modeling this process have been only moderately successful, and current models based on protein structural metrics explain, at best, 60\% of the observed variation. Surprisingly, simple measures of protein structure, such as solvent accessibility, are often better predictors of site-specific variability than more complex models employing all-atom energy functions and detailed structural modeling. We suggest here that these more complex models perform poorly because they lack consideration of the evolutionary process, which is, in part, captured by the simpler metrics. We compare protein sequences that are computationally designed to sequences that are computationally evolved using the same protein-design energy function and to homologous natural sequences. We find that, by a wide variety of metrics, evolved sequences are much more similar to natural sequences than are designed sequences. In particular, designed sequences are too conserved on the protein surface relative to natural sequences, whereas evolved sequences are not. Our results suggest that evolutionary simulation produces a realistic sampling of sequence space. By contrast, protein design—at least as currently implemented—does not. Existing energy functions seem to be sufficiently accurate to correctly describe the key thermodynamic constraints acting on protein sequences, but they need to be paired with realistic sampling schemes to generate realistic sequence alignments.},

	abstract = {Protein structures strongly influence molecular evolution. In particular, the evolutionary rate of a protein site depends on the number of its native contacts. Stability-constrained models of protein evolution consider this influence of protein structure on evolution by predicting the effect of mutations on the stability of the native state, but they currently neglect how mutations affect the protein structure. These models predict that buried protein sites with more native contacts are more constrained by natural selection and less variable, as observed. Nevertheless, previous work did not consider the stability against compact misfolded conformations, although it is known that the negative design that destabilizes these misfolded conformations influences protein evolution significantly. Here, we show that stability-constrained models that consider misfolding predict that site-specific sequence entropy and substitution rate peak at amphiphilic sites with an intermediate number of contacts, as these sites are less constrained than exposed sites with few contacts whose hydrophobicity must be limited. This result holds both for a mean-field model with independent sites and for a pairwise model that takes as a reference the wild-type sequence, but it contrasts with the observations that indicate that the entropy and the substitution rate decrease monotonically with the number of contacts. Our work suggests that stability-constrained models overestimate the tolerance of amphiphilic sites against mutations, either because of the limits of the free energy function or, more importantly in our opinion, because they do not consider how mutations perturb the native protein structure.},

This is used to show that the rate ratio {dN}/{dS} at a site can be transiently {\textbackslash}textgreater1 even when fitness coefficients are fixed or the fitness landscape is static. This occurs whenever a site drifts away from its fitness peak and is then forced back by selection, a process reminiscent of shifting balance. Shifting balance is strongest when the substitution process is not dominated by selection or drift, but admits interplay between the two. Under this condition, site-specific changes in {dN}/{dS} were inferred in 78-100\% of trials, and positive selection (i.e., {dN}/{dS}{\textbackslash}textgreater1) in 10-40\% of trials, when sequence alignments generated under {MutSel} were fitted to two popular phenomenological branch-site models. These results demonstrate that positive selection can occur without a change in fitness regime, and that this is detectable by branch-site models. In addition, {MutSel} is used to show that a site can be occupied by a sub-optimal amino acid for long periods on a fixed landscape when selection is stringent. This has implications for the interpretation of constant-but-different site patterns typically attributed to changes in fitness. Furthermore, a version of {MutSel} with episodic changes in fitness coefficients is used to illustrate systematic differences between parameters used to generate data under {MutSel} and their counterparts estimated by a simple codon model. Motivated by a discrepancy in the literature, interpretation of {dN}/{dS} in the context of {MutSel} is also discussed.},

	abstract = {A central objective in biology is to link adaptive evolution in a gene to structural and/or functional phenotypic novelties. Yet most analytic methods make inferences mainly from either phenotypic data or genetic data alone. A small number of models have been developed to infer correlations between the rate of molecular evolution and changes in a discrete or continuous life history trait. But such correlations are not necessarily evidence of adaptation. Here, we present a novel approach called the phenotype-genotype branch-site model ({PG}-{BSM}) designed to detect evidence of adaptive codon evolution associated with discrete-state phenotype evolution. An episode of adaptation is inferred under standard codon substitution models when there is evidence of positive selection in the form of an elevation in the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratio \${\textbackslash}backslashomega\$ to a value \${\textbackslash}backslashomega {\textbackslash}textgreater 1\$. As it is becoming increasingly clear that \${\textbackslash}backslashomega {\textbackslash}textgreater 1\$ can occur without adaptation, the {PG}-{BSM} was formulated to infer an instance of adaptive evolution without appealing to evidence of positive selection. The null model makes use of a covarion-like component to account for general heterotachy (i.e., random changes in the evolutionary rate at a site over time). The alternative model employs samples of the phenotypic evolutionary history to test for phenomenological patterns of heterotachy consistent with specific mechanisms of molecular adaptation. These include 1) a persistent increase/decrease in \${\textbackslash}backslashomega\$ at a site following a change in phenotype (the pattern) consistent with an increase/decrease in the functional importance of the site (the mechanism); and 2) a transient increase in \${\textbackslash}backslashomega\$ at a site along a branch over which the phenotype changed (the pattern) consistent with a change in the site's optimal amino acid (the mechanism). Rejection of the null is followed by post hoc analyses to identify sites with strongest evidence for adaptation in association with changes in the phenotype as well as the most likely evolutionary history of the phenotype. Simulation studies based on a novel method for generating mechanistically realistic signatures of molecular adaptation show that the {PG}-{BSM} has good statistical properties. Analyses of real alignments show that site patterns identified post hoc are consistent with the specific mechanisms of adaptation included in the alternate model. Further simulation studies show that the covarion-like component of the {PG}-{BSM} plays a crucial role in mitigating recently discovered statistical pathologies associated with confounding by accounting for heterotachy-by-any-cause.

Accurate inference of the high-copy-number elements of the {SFS} is difficult, however, because of misassignment of alleles as derived vs. ancestral. This is a known problem with parsimony using outgroup species. Here we show that the problem is particularly serious if there is variation in the substitution rate among sites brought about by variation in selective constraint levels. We present a new method for inferring the {SFS} using one or two outgroups that attempts to overcome the problem of misassignment. We show that two outgroups are required for accurate estimation of the {SFS} if there is substantial variation in selective constraints, which is expected to be the case for nonsynonymous sites in protein-coding genes. We apply the method to estimate unfolded {SFSs} for synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in a population of Drosophila melanogaster from phase 2 of the Drosophila Population Genomics Project. We use the unfolded spectra to estimate the frequency and strength of advantageous and deleterious mutations and estimate that ∼50\% of amino acid substitutions are positively selected but that {\textbackslash}textless0.5\% of new amino acid mutations are beneficial, with a scaled selection strength of Nes ≈ 12.},

	abstract = {It is known that the allele ancestral to the variation at a polymorphic site cannot be assigned with certainty, and that the most frequently used method to assign the ancestral state—maximum parsimony—is prone to misinference. Estimates of counts of sites that have a certain number of copies of the derived allele in a sample (the unfolded site frequency spectrum, {uSFS}) made by parsimony are therefore also biased. We previously developed a maximum likelihood method to estimate the {uSFS} for a focal species using information from two outgroups while assuming simple models of nucleotide substitution. Here, we extend this approach to allow multiple outgroups (implemented for three outgroups), potentially any phylogenetic tree topology, and more complex models of nucleotide substitution. We find, however, that two outgroups and the Kimura two-parameter model are adequate for {uSFS} inference in most cases. We show that using parsimony to infer the ancestral state at a specific site seriously breaks down in two situations. The first is where the outgroups provide no information about the ancestral state of variation in the focal species. In this case, nucleotide variation will be underestimated if such sites are excluded. The second is where the minor allele in the focal species agrees with the allelic state of the outgroups. In this situation, parsimony tends to overestimate the probability of the major allele being derived, because it fails to account for the fact that sites with a high frequency of the derived allele tend to be rare. We present a method that corrects this deficiency and is capable of providing nearly unbiased estimates of ancestral state probabilities on a site-by-site basis and the {uSFS}.},

Major types of repetitive {DNA} include transposable elements, satellite {DNAs}, simple sequences and tandem repeats, but reliable estimates of the relative contributions of these various types to total genome size have been hard to obtain. With the advent of genome sequencing, such information is starting to become available, but no firm conclusions can yet be made from the limited data currently available. Here, the ways in which transposable elements contribute both directly and indirectly to genome size variation are explored. Limited evidence is provided to support the existence of an approximately linear relationship between total transposable element {DNA} and genome size. Copy numbers per family are low and globally constrained in small genomes, but vary widely in large genomes. Thus, the partial release of transposable element copy number constraints appears to be a major characteristic of large genomes.},

Thus, estimates of the proportion of moderately to strongly deleterious new mutations may be unreliable because such variants are unlikely to be segregating in the data. Additionally, the true functional form of the {DFE} is unknown, and estimates of the {DFE} differ significantly between studies. Here we present a flexible and computationally tractable method, called Fit∂a∂i, to estimate the {DFE} of new mutations using the site frequency spectrum from a large number of individuals. We apply our approach to the frequency spectrum of 1300 Europeans from the Exome Sequencing Project {ESP}6400 data set, 1298 Danes from the {LuCamp} data set, and 432 Europeans from the 1000 Genomes Project to estimate the {DFE} of deleterious nonsynonymous mutations. We infer significantly fewer (0.38-0.84 fold) strongly deleterious mutations with selection coefficient {\textbar}s{\textbar} {\textbackslash}textless 0.01 and more (1.24-1.43 fold) weakly deleterious mutations with selection coefficient {\textbar}s{\textbar} {\textbackslash}textless0.001 compared to previous estimates. Furthermore, a {DFE} that is a mixture distribution of a point mass at neutrality plus a gamma distribution fits better than a gamma distribution in two of the three data sets.

Ten types of hydrogen bonding are identified which define the specificity of tertiary interactions. The molecule is also stabilized by considerable stacking of the planar purities and pyrimidines. This tertiary structure explains, in a simple and direct fashion, chemical modification studies of transfer {RNA}. Since most of the tertiary interactions involve nucleotides which are common to all transfer {RNA}'s, it is likely that this three-dimensional structure provides a basic pattern of folding which may help to clarify the three-dimensional structure of all transfer {RNA}'s.},

	abstract = {Based on the idea that selective neutrality is the limit when the selective disadvantage becomes indefinitely small, a model of neutral (and nearly neutral) mutations is proposed that assumes that the selection coefficient against the mutant at various sites within a cistrom (gene) follows a special distribution. The mutation rate for alleles whose selection coefficients s' lie in the range between 0 and 1/(2Ne), in which Ne is the effective population size, is termed the effectively neutral mutation rate. Using the model of 'infinite sites' in population genetics, formulas are derived giving the average heterozygosity and evolutionary rate per generation in terms of mutant substitutions. It is shown that, the average heterozygosity increases much more slowly as Ne increases, compared with the case in which a constant fraction of mutations are neutral. Furthermore, the rate of evolution per year (k1) becomes constant among various organisms, if the generation span (g) in years is inversely proportional to √Ne among them and if the mutation rate per generation is constant. The situation becomes quite different if slightly advantageous mutations occur at a constant rate independent of environmental conditions. In this case, the evolutionary rate can become enormously higher in a species with a very large population size than in a species with a small population size, contrary to the observed pattern of evolution at the molecular level.},

They are; (1) remarkable uniformity for each molecule, and (2) very high overall rate when extrapolated to the whole {DNA} content. The population dynamics for the rate of mutant substitution was developed, and it was shown that if mutant substitutions in the population are carried out mainly by natural selection, the rate of substitution is given by k = 4 Nes1v, where Ne is the effective population number, s1 is the selective advantage of the mutants, and v is the mutation rate per gamete for such advantageous mutants (assuming that 4 Nes1 ≫ 1). On the other hand, if the substitutions are mainly carried out by random fixation of selectively neutral or nearly neutral mutants, we have k = v, where v is the mutation rate per gamete for such mutants. Reasons were presented for the view that evolutionary change of amino acids in proteins has been mainly caused by random fixation of neutral mutants rather than by natural selection. It was concluded that if this view is correct, we should expect that genes of "living fossils" have undergone almost as many {DNA} base replacements as the corresponding genes of more rapidly evolving species. © 1971 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Assessing the influence of three-dimensional protein structure on sequence evolution is a difficult task, mainly because of the assumption of independence between sites required by probabilistic phylogenetic methods. Recently, models that include an explicit treatment of protein structure and site interdependencies have been developed: a statistical potential (an energy-like scoring system for sequence–structure compatibility) is used to evaluate the probability of fixation of a given mutation, assuming a coarse-grained protein structure that is constant through evolution. Yet, due to the novelty of these models and the small degree of overlap between the fields of structural and evolutionary biology, only simple representations of protein structure have been used so far. In this work, we present new forms of statistical potentials using a probabilistic framework recently developed for evolutionary studies. Terms related to pairwise distance interactions, torsion angles, solvent accessibility, and flexibility of the residues are included in the potentials, so as to study the effects of the main factors known to influence protein structure. The new potentials, with a more detailed representation of the protein structure, yield a better fit than the previously used scoring functions, with pairwise interactions contributing to more than half of this improvement. In a phylogenetic context, however, the structurally constrained models are still outperformed by some of the available site-independent models in terms of fit, possibly indicating that alternatives to coarse-grained statistical potentials should be explored in order to better model structural constraints.},

The {DNA}'s used (Fig. 1) were: four double-stranded {DNA}'s with the termini containing the 5′-hydroxyl group protruding by one, three, four or ten nucleotide units and two single-stranded {DNA}'s 29 units long which are capable of folding back on themselves. The aspects inve tigated were: (1) completion of repair, (2) the minimum size of the polynucleotide chains required as primers and those which can serve as templates and (3) the minimum size of the primers which can abolish hairpin formation so as to give the "normal" repair replication. Repair replication of {DNA}'s ({DNA}-I to {DNA}-{IV}: Fig. 1) was characterized to be essentially complete. The minimum size of the primer for repair replication of an extended single-stranded deoxypolynucleotide was ascertained to be about five to seven units long, while the primers required to overcome the hairpin formation in {DNA}-V and {DNA}-{VI} were found to be about twelve units long. Thus, in the presence of a suitable primer, the nucleotide incorporation which occurs in {DNA}-V in the absence of added primer was completely replaced by incorporation expected for normal repair replication.

	abstract = {A significant part of eukaryotic noncoding {DNA} is viewed as the passive result of mutational processes, such as the proliferation of mobile elements. However, sequences lacking an immediate utility can nonetheless play a major role in the long-term evolvability of a lineage, for instance by promoting genomic rearrangements. They could thus be subject to an indirect selection. Yet, such a long-term effect is difficult to isolate either in vivo or in vitro. Here, by performing in silico experimental evolution, we demonstrate that, under low mutation rates, the indirect selection of variability promotes the accumulation of noncoding sequences: Even in the absence of self-replicating elements and mutational bias, noncoding sequences constituted an important fraction of the evolved genome because the indirectly selected genomes were those that were variable enough to discover beneficial mutations. On the other hand, high mutation rates lead to compact genomes, much like the viral ones, although no selective cost of genome size was applied: The indirectly selected genomes were those that were small enough for the genetic information to be reliably transmitted. Thus, the spontaneous evolution of the amount of noncoding {DNA} strongly depends on the mutation rate. Our results suggest the existence of an additional pressure on the amount of noncoding {DNA}, namely the indirect selection of an appropriate trade-off between the fidelity of the transmission of the genetic information and the exploration of the mutational neighborhood. Interestingly, this trade-off resulted robustly in the accumulation of noncoding {DNA} so that the best individual leaves one offspring without mutation (or only neutral ones) per generation.},

	abstract = {We consider three approaches for estimating the rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes at each site in a sequence alignment in order to identify sites under positive or negative selection: (1) a suite of fast likelihood-based "counting methods" that employ either a single most likely ancestral reconstruction, weighting across all possible ancestral reconstructions, or sampling from ancestral reconstructions; (2) a random effects likelihood ({REL}) approach, which models variation in nonsynonymous and synonymous rates across sites according to a predefined distribution, with the selection pressure at an individual site inferred using an empirical Bayes approach; and (3) a fixed effects likelihood ({FEL}) method that directly estimates nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates at each site. All three methods incorporate flexible models of nucleotide substitution bias and variation in both nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates across sites, facilitating the comparison between the methods. We demonstrate that the results obtained using these approaches show broad agreement in levels of Type I and Type {II} error and in estimates of substitution rates. Counting methods are well suited for large alignments, for which there is high power to detect positive and negative selection, but appear to underestimate the substitution rate. A {REL} approach, which is more computationally intensive than counting methods, has higher power than counting methods to detect selection in data sets of intermediate size but may suffer from higher rates of false positives for small data sets. A {FEL} approach appears to capture the pattern of rate variation better than counting methods or random effects models, does not suffer from as many false positives as random effects models for data sets comprising few sequences, and can be efficiently parallelized. Our results suggest that previously reported differences between results obtained by counting methods and random effects models arise due to a combination of the conservative nature of counting-based methods, the failure of current random effects models to allow for variation in synonymous substitution rates, and the naive application of random effects models to extremely sparse data sets. We demonstrate our methods on sequence data from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 env and pol genes and simulated alignments. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

	abstract = {Markov models of codon substitution are powerful inferential tools for studying biological processes such as natural selection and preferences in amino acid substitution. The equilibrium character distributions of these models are almost always estimated using nucleotide frequencies observed in a sequence alignment, primarily as a matter of historical convention. In this note, we demonstrate that a popular class of such estimators are biased, and that this bias has an adverse effect on goodness of fit and estimates of substitution rates. We propose a “corrected” empirical estimator that begins with observed nucleotide counts, but accounts for the nucleotide composition of stop codons. We show via simulation that the corrected estimates outperform the de facto standard estimates not just by providing better estimates of the frequencies themselves, but also by leading to improved estimation of other parameters in the evolutionary models. On a curated collection of sequence alignments, our estimators show a significant improvement in goodness of fit compared to the approach. Maximum likelihood estimation of the frequency parameters appears to be warranted in many cases, albeit at a greater computational cost. Our results demonstrate that there is little justification, either statistical or computational, for continued use of the -style estimators.},

	abstract = {In the past, 2 kinds of Markov models have been considered to describe protein sequence evolution. Codon-level models have been mechanistic with a small number of parameters designed to take into account features, such as transition–transversion bias, codon frequency bias, and synonymous–nonsynonymous amino acid substitution bias. Amino acid models have been empirical, attempting to summarize the replacement patterns observed in large quantities of data and not explicitly considering the distinct factors that shape protein evolution. We have estimated the first empirical codon model ({ECM}). Previous codon models assume that protein evolution proceeds only by successive single nucleotide substitutions, but our results indicate that model accuracy is significantly improved by incorporating instantaneous doublet and triplet changes. We also find that the affiliations between codons, the amino acid each encodes and the physicochemical properties of the amino acids are main factors driving the process of codon evolution. Neither multiple nucleotide changes nor the strong influence of the genetic code nor amino acids' physicochemical properties form a part of standard mechanistic models and their views of how codon evolution proceeds. We have implemented the {ECM} for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis, and an assessment of its ability to describe protein evolution shows that it consistently outperforms comparable mechanistic codon models. We point out the biological interpretation of our {ECM} and possible consequences for studies of selection.},

While in yeast gene expression level is the major causal factor of gene evolutionary rate, the situation is more complex in animals. Here we investigate these relations further, especially taking in account gene expression in different organs as well as indirect correlations between parameters. We used {RNA}-seq data from two large datasets, covering 22 mouse tissues and 27 human tissues. Over all tissues, evolutionary rate only correlates weakly with levels and breadth of expression. The strongest explanatory factors of purifying selection are {GC} content, expression in many developmental stages, and expression in brain tissues. While the main component of evolutionary rate is purifying selection, we also find tissue-specific patterns for sites under neutral evolution and for positive selection. We observe fast evolution of genes expressed in testis, but also in other tissues, notably liver, which are explained by weak purifying selection rather than by positive selection.},

Recent studies have suggested that the overall rate of genome evolution is correlated with the rate of diversification. If true, this claimhas important consequences forunderstanding the process of diversification, and implications for the use of {DNA} sequence data to reconstruct evolutionary history. However, the generality and cause of this relationship have not been established. Here, we test the relationship between the rate of molecular evolution and net diversification with a 19-gene, 17-kb {DNA} sequence dataset from 64 families of birds. We show that rates of molecular evolution are positively correlated to net diversification in birds. Using a 7.6-kb dataset of protein-coding {DNA}, we show that the synonymous substitution rate, and therefore the mutation rate, is correlated to net diversification. Further analysis shows that the link between mutation rates and net diversification is unlikely to be the indirect result of correlations with life-history variables thatmay influence both quantities, suggesting that there might be a causal link between mutation rates and net diversification.},

On moderately large trees, the computational advantage of our method over bootstrapping a maximum-likelihood analysis can be considerable. In an example with 31 taxa, the time expended by our software is orders of magnitude less than that a widely used phylogeny package for bootstrapping maximum likelihood estimation would require to achieve comparable statistical accuracy. While there has been substantial debate over the proper interpretation of bootstrap proportions, Bayesian posterior probabilities clearly and directly quantify uncertainty in questions of biological interest, at least from a Bayesian perspective. Because our tree proposal algorithms are independent of the choice of likelihood function, they could also be used in conjunction with likelihood models more complex than those we have currently implemented.},

	abstract = {We propose a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) sampling mechanism for Bayesian phylogenetic inference. This method, which we call conjugate Gibbs, relies on analytical conjugacy properties, and is based on an alternation between data augmentation and Gibbs sampling. The data augmentation step consists in sampling a detailed substitution history for each site, and across the whole tree, given the current value of the model parameters. Provided convenient priors are used, the parameters of the model can then be directly updated by a Gibbs sampling procedure, conditional on the current substitution history. Alternating between these two sampling steps yields a {MCMC} device whose equilibrium distribution is the posterior probability density of interest. We show, on real examples, that this conjugate Gibbs method leads to a significant improvement of the mixing behavior of the {MCMC}. In all cases, the decorrelation times of the resulting chains are smaller than those obtained by standard Metropolis Hastings procedures by at least one order of magnitude. The method is particularly well suited to heterogeneous models, i.e. assuming site-specific random variables. In particular, the conjugate Gibbs formalism allows one to propose efficient implementations of complex models, for instance assuming site-specific substitution processes, that would not be accessible to standard {MCMC} methods. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference is now routinely used in phylogenomics and, more generally, in macro- evolutionary studies. Beyond the philosophical debates it has raised concerning the choice of the prior and the meaning of posterior probabilities, Bayesian inference, combined with generic Monte Carlo algorithms, offers a flexible framework for introducing subjective or context information through the prior, but also, for designing hierarchical models formalizing complex patterns of variation (across sites or branches) or the integration of multiple levels of evolutionary processes. In this chapter, the principles of Bayesian inference, such as applied to phylogenetic reconstruc- tion, are first introduced, with an emphasis on the key features of the Bayesian paradigm that explain its flexibility in terms of model design and its robustness in inferring complex patterns and processes. A more specific focus is then put on the question of modeling pattern-heterogeneity across sites, using both parametric and non-parametric random-effect models. Finally, the cur- rent computational challenges are discussed.},

	abstract = {Violation of the molecular clock has been amply documented, and is now routinely taken into account by molecular dating methods. Comparative analyses have revealed a systematic component in rate variation, relating it to the evolution of life-history traits, such as body size or generation time. Life-history evolution can be reconstructed using Brownian models. However, the resulting estimates are typically uncertain, and potentially sensitive to the underlying assumptions. As a way of obtaining more accurate ancestral trait and divergence time reconstructions, correlations between life-history traits and substitution rates could be used as an additional source of information. In this direction, a Bayesian framework for jointly reconstructing rates, traits, and dates was previously introduced. Here, we apply this model to a 17 protein-coding gene alignment for 73 placental taxa. Our analysis indicates that the coupling between molecules and life history can lead to a reevaluation of ancestral life-history profiles, in particular for groups displaying convergent evolution in body size. However, reconstructions are sensitive to fossil calibrations and to the Brownian assumption. Altogether, our analysis suggests that further integrating inference of rates and traits might be particularly useful for neontological macroevolutionary comparative studies. © 2012 The Author(s).

These systems have strikingly similar evolutionary dynamics driven by the competition of clades within a population. These dynamics are the basis for models that predict the evolution of clade frequencies, as well as broad genetic and phenotypic changes. Moreover, there are strong links between prediction and control, which are important for interventions such as vaccine or therapy design.

	abstract = {In humans and many other species, recombination events cluster in narrow and short-lived hot spots distributed across the genome, whose location is determined by the Zn-finger protein {PRDM}9. To explain these fast evolutionary dynamics, an intra-genomic Red Queen model has been proposed, based on the interplay between two antagonistic forces: biased gene conversion, mediated by double-strand breaks, resulting in hot-spot extinction, followed by positive selection favouring new {PRDM}9 alleles recognizing new sequence motifs. Thus far, however, this Red Queen model has not been formalized as a quantitative population-genetic model, fully accounting for the intricate interplay between biased gene conversion, mutation, selection, demography and genetic diversity at the {PRDM}9 locus. Here, we explore the population genetics of the Red Queen model of recombination. A Wright-Fisher simulator was implemented, allowing exploration of the behaviour of the model (mean equilibrium recombination rate, diversity at the {PRDM}9 locus or turnover rate) as a function of the parameters (effective population size, mutation and erosion rates). In a second step, analytical results based on self-consistent mean-field approximations were derived, reproducing the scaling relations observed in the simulations. Empirical fit of the model to current data from the mouse suggests both a high mutation rate at {PRDM}9 and strong biased gene conversion on its targets.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evolutionary causes and consequences of recombination rate variation in sexual organisms'.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary origin of the striking genome size variations found in eukaryotes remains enigmatic. The effective size of populations, by controlling selection efficacy, is expected to be a key parameter underlying genome size evolution. However, this hypothesis has proved difficult to investigate using empirical data sets. Here, we tested this hypothesis using 22 de novo transcriptomes and low-coverage genomes of asellid isopods, which represent 11 independent habitat shifts from surface water to resource-poor groundwater. We show that these habitat shifts are associated with higher transcriptomewide {dN}/{dS}. After ruling out the role of positive selection and pseudogenization, we show that these transcriptome-wide {dN}/{dS} increases are the consequence of a reduction in selection efficacy imposed by the smaller effective population size of subterranean species. This reduction is paralleled by an important increase in genome size (25\% increase on average), an increase also confirmed in subterranean decapods and mollusks. We also control for an adaptive impact of genome size on life history traits but find no correlation between body size, or growth rate, and genome size. We show instead that the independent increases in genome size measured in subterranean isopods are the direct consequence of increasing invasion rates by repeat elements, which are less efficiently purged out by purifying selection. Contrary to selection efficacy, polymorphism is not correlated to genome size. We propose that recent demographic fluctuations and the difficulty of observing polymorphism variation in polymorphism-poor species can obfuscate the link between effective population size and genome size when polymorphism data are used alone.},

In six cases, there is evidence for an ancestral polymorphism that persisted to the present in humans and chimpanzees. Regions with shared haplotypes are significantly enriched for membrane glycoproteins, and a similar trend is seen among shared coding polymorphisms.

	abstract = {Several models have been proposed to relax the molecular clock in order to estimate divergence times. However, it is unclear which model has the best fit to real data and should therefore be used to perform molecular dating. In particular, we do not know whether rate autocorrelation should be considered or which prior on divergence times should be used. In this work, we propose a general bench mark of alternative relaxed clock models. We have reimplemented most of the already existing models, including the popular lognormal model, as well as various prior choices for divergence times (birth-death, Dirichlet, uniform), in a common Bayesian statistical framework. We also propose a new autocorrelated model, called the "{CIR}" process, with well-defined stationary properties. We assess the relative fitness of these models and priors, when applied to 3 different protein data sets from eukaryotes, vertebrates, and mammals, by computing Bayes factors using a numerical method called thermodynamic integration. We find that the 2 autocorrelated models, {CIR} and lognormal, have a similar fit and clearly outperform uncorrelated models on all 3 data sets. In contrast, the optimal choice for the divergence time prior is more dependent on the data investigated. Altogether, our results provide useful guidelines for model choice in the field of molecular dating while opening the way to more extensive model comparisons. © The Author 2007.

Various studies have found evidence for a founder event (bottleneck) in East Asian and European populations, associated with the human dispersal out-of-Africa event around 60 thousand years (kyr) ago. However, these studies have had to assume simplified demographic models with few parameters, and they do not provide a precise date for the start and stop times of the bottleneck. Here, with fewer assumptions on population size changes, we present a more detailed history of human population sizes between approximately ten thousand and a million years ago, using the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent model applied to the complete diploid genome sequences of a Chinese male ({YH}), a Korean male ({SJK}), three European individuals (J. C. Venter, {NA}12891 and {NA}12878 (ref. 9)) and two Yoruba males ({NA}18507 (ref. 10) and {NA}19239). We infer that European and Chinese populations had very similar population-size histories before 10-20 kyr ago. Both populations experienced a severe bottleneck 10-60 kyr ago, whereas African populations experienced a milder bottleneck from which they recovered earlier. All three populations have an elevated effective population size between 60 and 250 kyr ago, possibly due to population substructure. We also infer that the differentiation of genetically modern humans may have started as early as 100-120 kyr ago, but considerable genetic exchanges may still have occurred until 20-40 kyr ago.},

Rates of nucleotide subsitution in rodents are estimated to be four to eight times higher than those in higher primates and two to four times higher than those in artiodactyls. There is strong evidence for lower substitution rates in apes and humans than in monkeys, supporting the hominoid slowdown hypothesis. There is also evidence for lower rates in humans than in apes, suggesting a further rate slowdown in the human lineage after the separation of humans from apes. By contrast, substitution rates are nearly equal in mouse and rat. These results suggest that differences in generation time or, more precisely, in the number of germline {DNA} replications per year are the primary cause of rate differences in mammals.

	abstract = {The interface of protein structural biology, protein biophysics, molecular evolution, and molecular population genetics forms the foundations for a mechanistic understanding of many aspects of protein biochemistry. Current efforts in interdisciplinary protein modeling are in their infancy and the state-of-the art of such models is described. Beyond the relationship between amino acid substitution and static protein structure, protein function, and corresponding organismal fitness, other considerations are also discussed. More complex mutational processes such as insertion and deletion and domain rearrangements and even circular permutations should be evaluated. The role of intrinsically disordered proteins is still controversial, but may be increasingly important to consider. Protein geometry and protein dynamics as a deviation from static considerations of protein structure are also important. Protein expression level is known to be a major determinant of evolutionary rate and several considerations including selection at the {mRNA} level and the role of interaction specificity are discussed. Lastly, the relationship between modeling and needed high-throughput experimental data as well as experimental examination of protein evolution using ancestral sequence resurrection and in vitro biochemistry are presented, towards an aim of ultimately generating better models for biological inference and prediction. © 2012 The Protein Society.},

	abstract = {Transfer {RNAs} ({tRNAs}) are ubiquitous across the tree of life. Although {tRNA} structure is highly conserved, there is still significant variation in sequence features between clades, isotypes and even isodecoders. This variation not only impacts translation, but as shown by a variety of recent studies, nontranslation-associated functions are also sensitive to small changes in {tRNA} sequence. Despite the rapidly growing number of sequenced genomes, there is a lack of tools for both small- and large-scale comparative genomics analysis of {tRNA} sequence features. Here, we have integrated over 150 000 {tRNAs} spanning all domains of life into {tRNAviz}, a web application for exploring and visualizing {tRNA} sequence features. {tRNAviz} implements a framework for determining consensus sequence features and can generate sequence feature distributions by isotypes, clades and anticodons, among other {tRNA} properties such as score. All visualizations are interactive and exportable. The web server is publicly available at http://trna.ucsc.edu/{tRNAviz}/.},

	abstract = {It is currently unclear whether the amino acid substitutions that occur during protein evolution are primarily driven by adaptation, or reflect the random accumulation of neutral changes. When estimated from genomic data, the proportion of adaptive amino acid substitutions, called α, was found to vary greatly across species, from nearly zero in humans to above 0.5 in Drosophila. These variations have been interpreted as reflecting differences in effective population size, adaptation being supposedly more efficient in large populations. Here, we investigate the influence of effective population size and other biological parameters on the rate of adaptive evolution by simulating the evolution of a coding sequence under Fisher's geometric formalism. We explicitly model recurrent environmental changes and the subsequent adaptive walks, followed by periods of stasis during which purifying selection dominates. We show that, under a variety of conditions, the effective population size has only a moderate influence on α, and an even weaker influence on the per generation rate of selective sweeps, modifying the prevalent view in current literature. The rate of environmental change and, interestingly, the dimensionality of the phenotypic space (organismal complexity) affect the adaptive rate more deeply than does the effective population size. We discuss the reasons why verbal arguments have been misleading on that subject and revisit the empirical evidence. Our results question the relevance of the “α” parameter as an indicator of the efficiency of molecular adaptation.},

	abstract = {Binding interactions between proteins and other molecules mediate numerous cellular processes, including metabolism, signaling, and gene regulation. These interactions often evolve in response to changes in the protein's chemical or physical environment (such as the addition of an antibiotic). Several recent studies have shown the importance of folding stability in constraining protein evolution. Here we investigate how structural coupling between folding and binding-the fact that most proteins can only bind their targets when folded-gives rise to an evolutionary coupling between the traits of folding stability and binding strength. Using a biophysical and evolutionary model, we show how these protein traits can emerge as evolutionary "spandrels" even if they do not confer an intrinsic fitness advantage. In particular, proteins can evolve strong binding interactions that have no functional role but merely serve to stabilize the protein if its misfolding is deleterious. Furthermore, such proteins may have divergent fates, evolving to bind or not bind their targets depending on random mutational events. These observations may explain the abundance of apparently nonfunctional interactions among proteins observed in high-throughput assays. In contrast, for proteins with both functional binding and deleterious misfolding, evolution may be highly predictable at the level of biophysical traits: adaptive paths are tightly constrained to first gain extra folding stability and then partially lose it as the new binding function is developed. These findings have important consequences for our understanding of how natural and engineered proteins evolve under selective pressure.},

We first consider evolution on a simple Mount Fuji fitness landscape, focusing on how the length and predictability of evolutionary paths scale with the coarse-grained sequence length and alphabet. We obtain simple scaling relations for both the weak- and strong-selection limits, with a non-trivial crossover regime at intermediate selection strengths. We apply these results to evolution on a biophysical fitness landscape that describes how proteins evolve new binding interactions while maintaining their folding stability. We combine the scaling relations with numerical calculations for coarse-grained protein sequences to obtain quantitative properties of the model for realistic binding interfaces and a full amino acid alphabet.},

The first is the case of mutual learning between members of an organization and an organizational code. The second is the case of learning and competitive advantage in competition for primacy. The paper develops an argument that adaptive processes, by refining exploitation more rapidly than exploration, are likely to become effective in the short run but self-destructive in the long run.

	abstract = {Many models of evolution calculate the rate of evolution by multiplying the rate at which new mutations originate within a population by a probability of fixation. Here we review the historical origins, contemporary applications, and evolutionary implications of these "origin-fixation" models, which are widely used in evolutionary genetics, molecular evolution, and phylogenetics. Origin-fixation models were first introduced in 1969, in association with an emerging view of "molecular" evolution. Early origin-fixationmodels were used to calculate an instantaneous rate of evolution across a large number of independently evolving loci; in the 1980s and 1990s, a second wave of origin-fixation models emerged to address a sequence of fixation events at a single locus. Although origin-fixation models have been applied to a broad array of problems in contemporary evolutionary research, their rise in popularity has not been accompanied by an increased appreciation of their restrictive assumptions or their distinctive implications. We argue that origin-fixation models constitute a coherent theory of mutation-limited evolution that contrasts sharply with theories of evolution that rely on the presence of standing genetic variation. A major unsolved question in evolutionary biology is the degree to which these models provide an accurate approximation of evolution in natural populations. © 2014 by The University of Chicago Press.

However, while the higher-level relationships among cetacean families have been largely settled, several aspects of the systematics within these groups remain unresolved. Problematic clades include the oceanic dolphins (37 spp.), which have experienced a recent rapid radiation, and the beaked whales (22 spp.), which have not been investigated in detail using nuclear loci. The combined application of high-throughput sequencing with techniques that target specific genomic sequences provide a powerful means of rapidly generating large volumes of orthologous sequence data for use in phylogenomic studies. To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the Cetacea, we combined sequence capture with Illumina sequencing to generate data for ∼3200 protein-coding genes for 68 cetacean species and their close relatives including the pygmy hippopotamus. By combining data from {\textbackslash}textgreater38,000 exons with existing sequences from 11 cetaceans and seven outgroup taxa, we produced the first comprehensive comparative genomic dataset for cetaceans, spanning 6,527,596 aligned base pairs and 89 taxa. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed with maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference of concatenated loci, as well as with coalescence analyses of individual gene trees, produced mostly concordant and well-supported trees. Our results completely resolve the relationships among beaked whales as well as the contentious relationships among oceanic dolphins, especially the problematic subfamily Delphininae. We carried out Bayesian estimation of species divergence times using {MCMCTree}, and compared our complete dataset to a subset of clocklike genes. Analyses using the complete dataset consistently showed less variance in divergence times than the reduced dataset. In addition, integration of new fossils (e.g., Mystacodon selenensis) indicate that the diversification of Crown Cetacea began before the Late Eocene and the divergence of Crown Delphinidae as early as the Middle Miocene.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

We argue that this endeavor will benefit from the development and use of meaningful basic models against which to compare more complex models. Here we develop statistical and computational methods for fitting fitness data from mutation combinatorial networks to three simple models: additive, multiplicative and stickbreaking. We employ a Bayesian framework for doing model selection. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our methods work and we explore their statistical performance: bias, error, and the power to discriminate among models. We then illustrate our approach and its flexibility by analyzing several previously published datasets.

Positive design targets the first type of stability by strengthening native interactions. The second type of stability is achieved by destabilizing interactions that occur frequently in the misfolded ensemble, a strategy called negative design. Here, we investigate negative design adopting a statistical mechanical model of the misfolded ensemble, which improves the usual Gaussian approximation by taking into account the third moment of the energy distribution and contact correlations. Applying this model, we detect and quantify selection for negative design in most natural proteins, and we analytically design protein sequences that are stable both against unfolding and against misfolding.

	abstract = {The common understanding of protein evolution has been that neutral mutations are fixed by random drift, and a proportion of neutral mutations depending on the strength of structural and functional constraints primarily determines evolutionary rate. Recently it was indicated that fitness costs due to misfolded proteins are a determinant of evolutionary rate and selection originating in protein stability is a driving force of protein evolution. Here we examine protein evolution under the selection maintaining protein stability. Protein fitness is a generic form of fitness costs due to misfolded proteins; s=κ exp(ΔG/{kT}). (1 - exp(ΔΔG/{kT})), where s and ΔΔG are selective advantage and stability change of a mutant protein, ΔG is the folding free energy of the wildtype protein, and κ is a parameter representing protein abundance and indispensability. The distribution of ΔΔG is approximated to be a bi-Gaussian distribution, which represents structurally slightly- or highly-constrained sites. Also, the mean of the distribution is negatively proportional to ΔG. The evolution of this gene has an equilibrium point (ΔGe) of protein stability, the range of which is consistent with observed values in the {ProTherm} database. The probability distribution of Ka/Ks, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate per site, over fixed mutants in the vicinity of the equilibrium shows that nearly neutral selection is predominant only in low-abundant, non-essential proteins of ΔGe{\textbackslash}textgreater-2.5kcal/mol. In the other proteins, positive selection on stabilizing mutations are significant to maintain protein stability at equilibrium as well as random drift on slightly negative mutations, although the average 〈Ka/Ks〉 is less than 1. Slow evolutionary rates can be caused by both high protein abundance/indispensability and large effective population size, which produces positive shifts of ΔΔG through decreasing ΔGe, and strong structural constraints, which directly make ΔΔG more positive. Protein abundance/indispensability more affect evolutionary rate for less constrained proteins, and structural constraint for less abundant, less essential proteins. The effect of protein indispensability on evolutionary rate may be hidden by the variation of protein abundance and detected only in low-abundant proteins. Also, ΔGe/{kT} and 〈Ka/Ks〉 are predicted to decrease as growth temperature increases.},

	abstract = {Many bacteria live only within animal cells and infect hosts through cytoplasmic inheritance. These endosymbiotic lineages show distinctive population structure, with small population size and effectively no recombination. As a result, endosymbionts are expected to accumulate mildly deleterious mutations. If these constitute a substantial proportion of new mutations, endosymbionts will show (i) faster sequence evolution and (ii) a possible shift in base composition reflecting mutational bias. Analyses of 16S {rDNA} of five independently derived endosymbiont clades show, in every case, faster evolution in endosymbionts than in free-living relatives. For aphid endosymbionts (genus Buchnera), coding genes exhibit accelerated evolution and unusually low ratios of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions compared to ratios for the same genes for enterics. This concentration of the rate increase in nonsynonymous substitutions is expected under the hypothesis of increased fixation of deleterious mutations. Polypeptides for all Buchnera genes analyzed have accumulated amino acids with codon families rich in A+T, supporting the hypothesis that substitutions are deleterious in terms of polypeptide function. These observations are best explained as the result of Muller's ratchet within small asexual populations, combined with mutational bias. In light of this explanation, two observations reported earlier for Buchnera, the apparent loss of a repair gene and the overproduction of a chaperonin, may reflect compensatory evolution. An alternative hypothesis, involving selection on genomic base composition, is contradicted by the observation that the speedup is concentrated at nonsynonymous sites.},

Recent developments in population genomics allow inferring rates of adaptive mutations by fitting a distribution of fitness effects to the observed patterns of polymorphism and divergence at sites under selection and sites assumed to evolve neutrally. Here, we summarize the current state-of-the-art of these methods and review the factors that affect the molecular rate of adaptation. Several studies have reported extensive cross-species variation in the proportion of adaptive amino-acid substitutions (α) and predicted that species with larger effective population sizes undergo less genetic drift and higher rates of adaptation. Disentangling the rates of positive and negative selection, however, revealed that mutations with deleterious effects are the main driver of this population size effect and that adaptive substitution rates vary comparatively little across species. Conversely, rates of adaptive substitution have been documented to vary substantially within genomes. On a genome-wide scale, gene density, recombination and mutation rate were observed to play a role in shaping molecular rates of adaptation, as predicted under models of linked selection. At the gene level, it has been reported that the gene functional category and the macromolecular structure substantially impact the rate of adaptive mutations. Here, we deliver a comprehensive review of methods used to infer the molecular adaptive rate, the potential drivers of adaptive evolution and how positive selection shapes molecular evolution within genes, across genes within species and between species.},

To address this, we analyzed the impact of protein architecture on the rate of adaptive substitutions, aiming to understand how protein biophysics influences fitness and adaptation. Using Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana population genomics data, we fitted models of distribution of fitness effects and estimated the rate of adaptive amino-acid substitutions both at the protein and amino-acid residue level. We performed a comprehensive analysis covering genome, gene, and protein structure, by exploring a multitude of factors with a plausible impact on the rate of adaptive evolution, such as intron number, protein length, secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, intrinsic protein disorder, chaperone affinity, gene expression, protein function, and protein–protein interactions. We found that the relative solvent accessibility is a major determinant of adaptive evolution, with most adaptive mutations occurring at the surface of proteins. Moreover, we observe that the rate of adaptive substitutions differs between protein functional classes, with genes encoding for protein biosynthesis and degradation signaling exhibiting the fastest rates of protein adaptation. Overall, our results suggest that adaptive evolution in proteins is mainly driven by intermolecular interactions, with host–pathogen coevolution likely playing a major role.},

	abstract = {If substitution rates are not the same on the two complementary {DNA} strands, a substitution is considered strand asymmetric. Such substitutional strand asymmetries are determined here for the three most frequent types of substitution on the human genome (C → T, A → G, and G → T). Substitution rate differences between both strands are estimated for 4,590 human genes by aligning all repeats occurring within the introns with their ancestral consensus sequences. For 1,630 of these genes, both coding strand and noncoding strand rates could be compared with rates in gene-flanking regions. All three rates considered are found to be on average higher on the coding strand and lower on the transcribed strand in comparison to their values in the gene-flanking regions. This finding points to the simultaneous action of rate-increasing effects on the coding strand - such as increased adenine and cytosine deamination - and transcription-coupled repair as a rate-reducing effect on the transcribed strand. The common behavior of the three rates leads to strong correlations of the rate asymmetries: Whenever one rate is strand biased, the other two rates are likely to show the same bias. Furthermore, we determine all three rate asymmetries as a function of time: the A → G and G → T rate asymmetries are both found to be constant in time, whereas the C → T rate asymmetry shows a pronounced time dependence, an observation that explains the difference between our results and those of an earlier work by Green et al. (2003. Transcription-associated mutational asymmetry in mammalian evolution. Nat Genet. 33:514-517.).

	abstract = {The ratio of divergence at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, {dN}/{dS}, is a widely used measure in evolutionary genetic studies to investigate the extent to which selection modulates gene sequence evolution. Originally tailored to codon sequences of distantly related lineages, {dN}/{dS} represents the ratio of fixed nonsynonymous to synonymous differences. The impact of ancestral and lineage-specific polymorphisms on {dN}/{dS}, which we here show to be substantial for closely related lineages, is generally neglected in estimation techniques of {dN}/{dS}. To address this issue, we formulate a codon model that is firmly anchored in population genetic theory, derive analytical expressions for the {dN}/{dS} measure by Poisson random field approximation in a Markovian framework and validate the derivations by simulations. In good agreement, simulations and analytical derivations demonstrate that {dN}/{dS} is biased by polymorphisms at short time scales and that it can take substantial time for the expected value to settle at its time limit where only fixed differences are considered. We further show that in any attempt to estimate the {dN}/{dS} ratio from empirical data the effect of the intrinsic fluctuations of a ratio of stochastic variables, can even under neutrality yield extreme values of {dN}/{dS} at short time scales or in regions of low mutation rate. Taken together, our results have significant implications for the interpretation of {dN}/{dS} estimates, the {McDonald}-Kreitman test and other related statistics, in particular for closely related lineages. © 2013 The Author 2013.

	abstract = {Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize sites into a relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection-an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian {AppRoximation} ({FUBAR}) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of {FUBAR} allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). {FUBAR} is available as a batch file within the latest {HyPhy} distribution (http://www.hyphy.org), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (http://www.datamonkey.org/). © 2013 The Author.},

We present a mixed effects model of evolution ({MEME}) that is capable of identifying instances of both episodic and pervasive positive selection at the level of an individual site.

We apply this model to cross-species comparisons of binding sites in bacteria and obtain a prediction method for binding sites that uses evolutionary information in a quantitative way.

Our approach extends the static concept of fitness land- scapes to dynamic fitness seascapes. It shows that adaptation requires a surplus of beneficial substitutions over deleterious ones.

	abstract = {The nearly neutral theory, which proposes that most mutations are deleterious or close to neutral, predicts that the ratio of nonsynonymous over synonymous substitution rates ({dN}/{dS}), and potentially also the ratio of radical over conservative amino acid replacement rates (Kr/Kc), are negatively correlated with effective population size. Previous empirical tests, using life-history traits ({LHT}) such as body-size or generation-time as proxies for population size, have been consistent with these predictions. This suggests that large-scale phylogenetic reconstructions of {dN}/{dS} or Kr/Kc might reveal interesting macroevolutionary patterns in the variation in effective population size among lineages. In this work, we further develop an integrative probabilistic framework for phylogenetic covariance analysis introduced previously, so as to estimate the correlation patterns between {dN}/{dS}, Kr/Kc, and three {LHT}, in mitochondrial genomes of birds and mammals. Kr/Kc displays stronger and more stable correlations with {LHT} than does {dN}/{dS}, which we interpret as a greater robustness of Kr/Kc, compared with {dN}/{dS}, the latter being confounded by the high saturation of the synonymous substitution rate in mitochondrial genomes. The correlation of Kr/Kc with {LHT} was robust when controlling for the potentially confounding effects of nucleotide compositional variation between taxa. The positive correlation of the mitochondrial Kr/Kc with {LHT} is compatible with previous reports, and with a nearly neutral interpretation, although alternative explanations are also possible. The Kr/Kc model was finally used for reconstructing life-history evolution in birds and mammals. This analysis suggests a fairly large-bodied ancestor in both groups. In birds, life-history evolution seems to have occurred mainly through size reduction in Neoavian birds, whereas in placental mammals, body mass evolution shows disparate trends across subclades. Altogether, our work represents a further step toward a more comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolution of life-history and of the population-genetics environment.},

	abstract = {The fitness landscape of a locus, the array of fitnesses conferred by its alleles, can be affected by allele replacements at other loci, in the presence of epistatic interactions between loci. In a pair of diverging homologous proteins, the initially high probability that an amino acid replacement in one of them will make it more similar to the other declines with time, implying that the fitness landscapes of homologous sites diverge. Here, we use data on within-population non-synonymous polymorphisms and on amino acid replacements between species to study the dynamics, after an amino acid replacement, of the fitness of the ancestral amino acid, and show that selection against its restoration increases with time. This effect can be owing to increase of fitness conferred by the new amino acid occupying the site, and/or to decline of fitness conferred by the replaced amino acid. We show that the fitness conferred by the replaced amino acid rapidly declines, reaching a new lower steady-state level after approximately 20 per cent of amino acids in the protein get replaced. Therefore, amino acid replacements in evolving proteins are routinely involved in negative epistatic interactions with currently absent amino acids, and chisel off the unused parts of the fitness landscape. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Since the divergence of humans and chimpanzees about 5 million years ago, these species have undergone a remarkable evolution with drastic divergence in anatomy and cognitive abilities. At the molecular level, despite the small overall magnitude of {DNA} sequence divergence, we might expect such evolutionary changes to leave a noticeable signature throughout the genome. We here compare 13,731 annotated genes from humans to their chimpanzee orthologs to identify genes that show evidence of positive selection. Many of the genes that present a signature of positive selection tend to be involved in sensory perception or immune defenses. However, the group of genes that show the strongest evidence for positive selection also includes a surprising number of genes involved in tumor suppression and apoptosis, and of genes involved in spermatogenesis. We hypothesize that positive selection in some of these genes may be driven by genomic conflict due to apoptosis during spermatogenesis. Genes with maximal expression in the brain show little or no evidence for positive selection, while genes with maximal expression in the testis tend to be enriched with positively selected genes. Genes on the X chromosome also tend to show an elevated tendency for positive selection. We also present polymorphism data from 20 Caucasian Americans and 19 African Americans for the 50 annotated genes showing the strongest evidence for positive selection. The polymorphism analysis further supports the presence of positive selection in these genes by showing an excess of high-frequency derived nonsynonymous mutations. © 2005 Nielsen et al.},

Using the {ENCODE} sequence data, we estimated mammalian neutral evolutionary rates and selective pressures acting on conserved coding and noncoding elements. We show that neutral evolutionary rates can be explained by the generation time ({GT}) hypothesis. Accordingly, primates (especially humans), having longer {GTs} than other mammals, display slower rates of neutral evolution. The evolution of constrained elements, particularly of nonsynonymous sites, is in agreement with the expectations of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. We show that rates of nonsynonymous substitutions ({dN}) depend on the population size of a species. The results are robust to the exclusion of hypermutable {CpG} prone sites. The average rate of evolution in conserved noncoding sequences ({CNCs}) is 1.7 times higher than in nonsynonymous sites. Despite this, {CNCs} evolve at similar or even lower rates than nonsynonymous sites in the majority of basal branches of the eutherian tree. This observation could be the result of an overall gradual or, alternatively, lineage-specific relaxation of {CNCs}. The latter hypothesis was supported by the finding that 3 of the 20 longest {CNCs} displayed significant relaxation of individual branches. This observation may explain why the evolution of {CNCs} fits the expectations of the nearly neutral theory less well than the evolution of nonsynonymous sites. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA}.},

	abstract = {Two different strategies for stabilizing proteins are (i) positive design in which the native state is stabilized and (ii) negative design in which competing non-native conformations are destabilized. Here, the circumstances under which one strategy might be favored over the other are explored in the case of lattice models of proteins and then generalized and discussed with regard to real proteins. The balance between positive and negative design of proteins is found to be determined by their average "contact- frequency", a property that corresponds to the fraction of states in the conformational ensemble of the sequence in which a pair of residues is in contact. Lattice model proteins with a high average contact-frequency are found to use negative design more than model proteins with a low average contact-frequency. A mathematical derivation of this result indicates that it is general and likely to hold also for real proteins. Comparison of the results of correlated mutation analysis for real proteins with typical contact-frequencies to those of proteins likely to have high contactfrequencies (such as disordered proteins and proteins that are dependent on chaperonins for their folding) indicates that the latter tend to have stronger interactions between residues that are not in contact in their native conformation. Hence, our work indicates that negative design is employed when insufficient stabilization is achieved via positive design owing to high contact-frequencies. © 2009 Noivirt-Brik et al.},

	abstract = {Classically, phenotype is what is observed, and genotype is the genetic makeup. Statistical studies aim to project phenotypic likelihoods of genotypic patterns. The traditional geno-type-to-phenotype theory embraces the view that the encoded protein shape together with gene expression level largely determines the resulting phenotypic trait. Here, we point out that the molecular biology revolution at the turn of the century explained that the gene encodes not one but ensembles of conformations, which in turn spell all possible gene-asso-ciated phenotypes. The significance of a dynamic ensemble view is in understanding the linkage between genetic change and the gained observable physical or biochemical characteristics. Thus, despite the transformative shift in our understanding of the basis of protein structure and function, the literature still commonly relates to the classical genotype–phenotype paradigm. This is important because an ensemble view clarifies how even seemingly small genetic alterations can lead to pleiotropic traits in adaptive evolution and in disease, why cellular pathways can be modified in monogenic and polygenic traits, and how the environment may tweak protein function.},

	abstract = {Abstract Factors that influence the distribution, abundance, and diversification of species can simultaneously affect multiple evolutionary lineages within or across communities. These include changes to the environment or inter-specific ecological interactions that cause ranges of multiple species to contract, expand, or fragment. Such processes predict temporally clustered evolutionary events across species, such as synchronous population divergences and/or changes in population size. There have been a number of methods developed to infer shared divergences or changes in population size, but not both, and the latter has been limited to approximate methods. We introduce a full-likelihood Bayesian method that uses genomic data to estimate temporal clustering of an arbitrary mix of population divergences and population-size changes across taxa. Using simulated data, we find that estimating the timing and sharing of demographic changes tends to be inaccurate and sensitive to prior assumptions, which is in contrast to accurate, precise, and robust estimates of shared divergence times. We also show previous estimates of co-expansion among five Alaskan populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were likely driven by prior assumptions and ignoring invariant characters. We conclude by discussing potential avenues to improve the estimation of synchronous demographic changes across populations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved},

Therefore the rate of gene substitution increases in smaller populations, as smaller populations are likely to be distributed over less varied environments. The adequacy of the model was discussed in relation with the following facts or plausible postulates. 1. A large number of amino acid substitutions during a period corresponding to the formation of new species. 2. Rapid evolution at the phenotypic level of populations having a small size. 3.

	abstract = {The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts larger generation-time effects for synonymous than for nonsynonymous substitutions. This prediction is tested using the sequences of 49 single-copy genes by calculating the average and variance of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in mammalian star phylogenies (rodentia, artiodactyla, and primates). The average pattern of the 49 genes supports the prediction of the nearly neutral theory, with some notable exceptions. The nearly neutral theory also predicts that the variance of the evolutionary rate is larger than the value predicted by the completely neutral theory. This prediction is tested by examining the dispersion index (ratio of the variance to the mean), which is positively correlated with the average substitution number. After weighting by the lineage effects, this correlation almost disappears for nonsynonymous substitutions, but not quite so for synonymous substitutions. After weighting, the dispersion indices of both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions still exceed values expected under the simple Poisson process. The results indicate that both the systematic bias in evolutionary rate among the lineages and the episodic type of rate variation are contributing to the large variance. The former is more significant to synonymous substitutions than to nonsynonymous substitutions. Isochore evolution may be similar to synonymous substitutions. The rate and pattern found here are consistent with the nearly neutral theory, such that the relative contributions of drift and selection differ between the two types of substitutions. The results are also consistent with Gillespie's episodic selection theory. © 1995, Springer-Verlag New York Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The variations of evolutionary rates in hemoglobins and cytochrome c among various lines of vertebrates are analysed by estimating the variance. The observed variances appear to be larger than expected purely by chance. If the amino acid substitutions in evolution are the result of random fixation of selectively neutral or nearly neutral mutations, the evolutionary rate of cistrons can be represented by the integral of the product of mutation rate and fixation probability in terms of selective values around the neutral point. This integral is called the effective neutral mutation rate. The influence of effective population number and generation time on the effective neutral mutation rate is discussed. It is concluded that the uniformity of the rate of amino acid substitutions over diverse lines is compatible with random fixation of neutral or very slightly deleterious mutations which have some chance of being selected against during the course of substitution. On the other hand, definitely advantageous mutations will introduce significant variation in the substitution rate among lines. Approximately 10\% of the amino acid substitutions of average cistrons might be adaptive and create slight but significant variations in evolutionary rate among vertebrate lines, although the uniformity of evolutionary rate is still valid as a first approximation. © 1971 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {The onset of prezygotic and postzygotic barriers to gene flow between populations is a hallmark of speciation. One of the earliest postzygotic isolating barriers to arise between incipient species is the sterility of the heterogametic sex in interspecies' hybrids. Four genes that underlie hybrid sterility have been identified in animals: Odysseus, {JYalpha}, and Overdrive in Drosophila and Prdm9 (Meisetz) in mice. Mouse Prdm9 encodes a protein with a {KRAB} motif, a histone methyltransferase domain and several zinc fingers. The difference of a single zinc finger distinguishes Prdm9 alleles that cause hybrid sterility from those that do not. We find that concerted evolution and positive selection have rapidly altered the number and sequence of Prdm9 zinc fingers across 13 rodent genomes. The patterns of positive selection in Prdm9 zinc fingers imply that rapid evolution has acted on the interface between the Prdm9 protein and the {DNA} sequences to which it binds. Similar patterns are apparent for Prdm9 zinc fingers for diverse metazoans, including primates. Indeed, allelic variation at the {DNA}-binding positions of human {PRDM}9 zinc fingers show significant association with decreased risk of infertility. Prdm9 thus plays a role in determining male sterility both between species (mouse) and within species (human). The recurrent episodes of positive selection acting on Prdm9 suggest that the {DNA} sequences to which it binds must also be evolving rapidly. Our findings do not identify the nature of the underlying {DNA} sequences, but argue against the proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription factor in mouse meiosis. We propose a hypothetical model in which incompatibilities between Prdm9-binding specificity and satellite {DNAs} provide the molecular basis for Prdm9-mediated hybrid sterility. We suggest that Prdm9 should be investigated as a candidate gene in other instances of hybrid sterility in metazoans. © 2009 Oliver et al.},

This assumption has not, however, been justified on any biological or theoretical grounds. In this note, I study random mutation in one of the simplest models of mutation and adaptation - Fisher's geometric model. I show that random mutation in this model yields a distribution of mutational effects that belongs to the Gumbel type. I also show that the distribution of fitness effects among rare beneficial mutations in Fisher's model is asymptotically exponential. I confirm these analytic findings with exact computer simulations. These results provide some support for the use of Gumbel-type extreme value theory in studies of adaptation and point to a surprising connection between recent phenotypic- and sequence-based models of adaptation: in both, the distribution of fitness effects among rare beneficial mutations is approximately exponential. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigated the relationship between protein evolution and stability through the random mutational drift of a thermophilic bacterial protein, an esterase of Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (Aac-Est), at high and low temperatures. In the first random mutation of Aac-Est, few proteins exhibit increased activity at 65 °C, indicating that the wild-type ({WT}) Aac-Est is located on the peak of a mountain in a fitness landscape for activity at high temperature. To obtain higher active variants than those of {WT}, it must go down the mountain once and climb another, higher mountain. In the second and third generations from lower active templates, the evolvability (the proportion of variants with higher activity in all the variants obtained in a given generation than a parent protein) depended on the stability of the template proteins. Compared to {WT}, the stability-maintaining template could recover the activity more. Thus, a low-activity variant with high stability is able to drift vastly in sequence space and reach the foot of a higher mountain. Meanwhile, random mutations in stability-loss templates produced several variants with higher activity at 40 °C than those produced by {WT}, via cold adaptation. Our results indicate that maintaining protein stability enables the protein to search sequence space and evolve in the original environment, and proteins with lost stability use a cold adaptation path.},

Here, we introduce a statistical method to infer a detailed energy landscape of how a protein folds and binds to a ligand by combining information from many mutated variants. We fit a thermodynamic model describing the bound, unbound, and unfolded states to high quality data of protein G domain B1 binding to {IgG}-Fc. We infer distinct folding and binding energies for each mutation providing a detailed view of how mutations affect binding and stability across the protein. We accurately infer the folding energy of each variant in physical units, validated by independent data, whereas previous high-throughput methods could only measure indirect changes in stability. While we assume an additive sequence-energy relationship, the binding fraction is epistatic due its nonlinear relation to energy.

	abstract = {Background: Phylogenetic codon models are often used to characterize the selective regimes acting on protein-coding sequences. Recent methodological developments have led to models explicitly accounting for the interplay between mutation and selection, by modeling the amino acid fitness landscape along the sequence. However, thus far, most of these models have assumed that the fitness landscape is constant over time. Fluctuations of the fitness landscape may often be random or depend on complex and unknown factors. However, some organisms may be subject to systematic changes in selective pressure, resulting in reproducible molecular adaptations across independent lineages subject to similar conditions. Results: Here, we introduce a codon-based differential selection model, which aims to detect and quantify the fine-grained consistent patterns of adaptation at the protein-coding level, as a function of external conditions experienced by the organism under investigation. The model parameterizes the global mutational pressure, as well as the site- and condition-specific amino acid selective preferences. This phylogenetic model is implemented in a Bayesian {MCMC} framework. After validation with simulations, we applied our method to a dataset of {HIV} sequences from patients with known {HLA} genetic background. Our differential selection model detects and characterizes differentially selected coding positions specifically associated with two different {HLA} alleles. Conclusion: Our differential selection model is able to identify consistent molecular adaptations as a function of repeated changes in the environment of the organism. These models can be applied to many other problems, ranging from viral adaptation to evolution of life-history strategies in plants or animals.},

	abstract = {Rubisco (Ribulose-1, 5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is the most important enzyme on earth, catalyzing the first step of photosynthetic {CO}2 fixation. So, without it, there would be no storing of the sun's energy in plants. Molecular adaptation of Rubisco to C4 photosynthetic pathway has attracted a lot of attention. C4 plants, which comprise less than 5\% of land plants, have evolved more efficient photosynthesis compared to C3 plants. Interestingly, a large number of independent transitions from C3 to C4 phenotype have occurred. Each time, the Rubisco enzyme has been subject to similar changes in selective pressure, thus providing an excellent model for convergent evolution at the molecular level. Molecular adaptation is often identified with positive selection and is typically characterized by an elevated ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate ({dN}/{dS}). However, convergent adaptation is expected to leave a different molecular signature, taking the form of repeated transitions toward identical or similar amino acids. Here, we used a previously introduced codon-based differential-selection model to detect and quantify consistent patterns of convergent adaptation in Rubisco in eudicots. We further contrasted our results with those obtained by classical codon models based on the estimation of {dN}/{dS}. We found that the two classes of models tend to select distinct, although overlapping, sets of positions. This discrepancy in the results illustrates the conceptual difference between these models while emphasizing the need to better discriminate between qualitatively different selective regimes, by using a broader class of codon models than those currently considered in molecular evolutionary studies.},

Such violations of the molecular clock have been widely investigated for protein sequences, but not yet for protein structures. Here, we introduce a novel statistical test (Significant Clock Violations) and perform a large scale assessment of the molecular clock in the evolution of both protein sequences and structures in three large superfamilies. After validating our method with computer simulations, we find that clock violations are generally consistent in sequence and structure evolution, but they tend to be larger and more significant in structure evolution. Moreover, changes of function assessed through Gene Ontology and {InterPro} terms are associated with large and significant clock violations in structure evolution. We found that almost one third of significant clock violations are significant in structure evolution but not in sequence evolution, highlighting the advantage to use structure information for assessing accelerated evolution and gathering hints of positive selection. Clock violations between closely related pairs are frequently significant in sequence evolution, consistent with the observed time dependence of the substitution rate attributed to segregation of neutral and slightly deleterious polymorphisms, but not in structure evolution, suggesting that these substitutions do not affect protein structure although they may affect stability. These results are consistent with the view that natural selection, both negative and positive, constrains more strongly protein structures than protein sequences.

	abstract = {Bats harbor many viruses asymptomatically, including several notorious for causing extreme virulence in humans. To identify differences between antiviral mechanisms in humans and bats, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the genome of Rousettus aegyptiacus, a natural reservoir of Marburg virus and the only known reservoir for any filovirus. We found an expanded and diversified {KLRC}/{KLRD} family of natural killer cell receptors, {MHC} class I genes, and type I interferons, which dramatically differ from their functional counterparts in other mammals. Such concerted evolution of key components of bat immunity is strongly suggestive of novel modes of antiviral defense. An evaluation of the theoretical function of these genes suggests that an inhibitory immune state may exist in bats. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that tolerance of viral infection, rather than enhanced potency of antiviral defenses, may be a key mechanism by which bats asymptomatically host viruses that are pathogenic in humans. The genome of the Egyptian fruit bat reveals how its immune defenses allow tolerance of pathogenic viruses.},

Results: Here we present several lines of evidence that suggest, to the contrary, that the effective population size of {mtDNA} does vary, and that the variation can be substantial. First, we show that levels of mitochondrial and nuclear diversity are correlated within all groups of animals we surveyed. Second, we show that the effectiveness of selection on non-synonymous mutations, as measured by the ratio of the numbers of non-synonymous and synonymous polymorphisms, is negatively correlated to levels of mitochondrial diversity. Finally, we estimate the effective population size of mitochondrial {DNA} in selected mammalian groups and show that it varies by at least an order of magnitude. Conclusions: We conclude that there is variation in the effective population size of mitochondria. Furthermore we suggest that the relative constancy of {DNA} diversity may be due to a negative correlation between the effective population size and the mutation rate per generation. © 2009 Piganeau et al.},

The collected data allow us to rigorously test the predictions of the misfolding avoidance hypothesis that highly expressed proteins have evolved to be more stable, and that maintaining thermodynamic stability significantly constrains their evolution. Notably, reanalysis of the Leuenberger et al. data across four different organisms reveals no substantial correlation between protein stability and protein abundance. Therefore, the key predictions of the misfolding toxicity and related hypotheses are not supported by available empirical data.

It is therefore clear that these distinct roles for population size that characterize different processes should affect the evolution of proteins and need to be carefully defined. Empirical evidence is consistent with a role for demography in influencing protein evolution, supporting the idea that functional constraints alone do not determine the composition of coding sequences. Given that the relationship between population size, mutant fitness and fixation probability has been well characterized, estimating fitness from observed substitutions is well within reach with well-formulated models. Molecular evolution research has, therefore, increasingly begun to leverage concepts from population genetics to quantify the selective effects associated with different classes of mutation. However, in order for this type of analysis to provide meaningful information about the intra- and inter-specific evolution of coding sequences, a clear definition of concepts of population size, what they influence, and how they are best parameterized is essential. Here, we present an overview of the many distinct concepts that “population size” and “effective population size” may refer to, what they represent for studying proteins, and how this knowledge can be harnessed to produce better specified models of protein evolution.},

	abstract = {Methods for detecting nucleotide substitution rates that are faster or slower than expected under neutral drift are widely used to identify candidate functional elements in genomic sequences. However, most existing methods consider either reductions (conservation) or increases (acceleration) in rate but not both, or assume that selection acts uniformly across the branches of a phylogeny. Here we examine the more general problem of detecting departures from the neutral rate of substitution in either direction, possibly in a clade-specific manner. We consider four statistical, phylogenetic tests for addressing this problem: a likelihood ratio test, a score test, a test based on exact distributions of numbers of substitutions, and the genomic evolutionary rate profiling ({GERP}) test. All four tests have been implemented in a freely available program called {phyloP}. Based on extensive simulation experiments, these tests are remarkably similar in statistical power. With 36 mammalian species, they all appear to be capable of fairly good sensitivity with low false-positive rates in detecting strong selection at individual nucleotides, moderate selection in 3-bp elements, and weaker or clade-specific selection in longer elements. By applying {phyloP} to mammalian multiple alignments from the {ENCODE} project, we shed light on patterns of conservation/acceleration in known and predicted functional elements, approximate fractions of sites subject to constraint, and differences in clade-specific selection in the primate and glires clades. We also describe new "Conservation" tracks in the {UCSC} Genome Browser that display both {phyloP} and {phastCons} scores for genome-wide alignments of 44 vertebrate species. © 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

	abstract = {A recent paper by Ashenberg et al. (1) reports protein stability measurements and computational simulations that they claim contradict the results of our previous paper describing a "Stokes shift" in protein evolution (2). They make strong assertions that coevolutionary interactions among amino acids due to effects on stability do not significantly modify amino acid preferences or evolutionary patterns and thus are unimportant for phylo-genetics. However, on review, we find their experimental results are highly compatible with epistasis and Stokes shift theory. The apparent contradiction arises from their making sparse measurements on closely related strains of influenza, an inappropriate model system, and from ignoring most of our results. The evolutionary Stokes shift describes how, subsequent to fixation of an amino acid variant, epistatic interactions cause shifts in amino acid preferences, tending to make the newly resident amino acid more favorable. Ashenberg et al.'s study measured the melting temperature changes of only six different mutations (compared with the 300 × 19 in our work), none of which came close to fix-ation. The idiosyncratic nature of influenza population biology leads to frequent selective sweeps, inducing bottlenecks and partial fix-ation of deleterious mutations, whereas high mutation rates promote frequent back mutation. Furthermore, their studies considered mutations in closely related influenza strains in proteins that have evolved to buffer dele-terious mutations (3), a situation with limited opportunities for epistasis. Predisposing fluctuations leading to Stokes shifts would be modest under these conditions; correspondingly , Ashenberg et al. observe fluctuations in melting temperatures up to 3 °C. Contrary to their claims, this is epistasis and is highly compatible with our expectations when the resident amino acid is mostly constant. Ashenberg et al. claim that much of the discrepancy between their results and ours is that we force fixation of deleterious mutations and prevent back mutations. In contrast , we show in numerous simulations (ignored by Ashenberg et al.) that no such requirements are necessary; random fluctuations in the evolving sequence will occasionally predispose the protein toward a particular replacement. Neither their simulations nor our simulations are sufficiently accurate to make specific predictions about stabilities over moderate-to long-term evolution. An appropriate test of Stokes predictions of epistatic change after amino acid replacements is to calculate distributions of expected energetic differences in complementary mutations at sites with long-term fixed replacements. The changes in such free energies in moderately and highly diverged real proteins, presented in Pollock et al. (2), support our predictions, but were again ignored by Ashenberg et al. Also neglected was exciting recent work that extracted detailed structural information from epistatic interactions (4). The small differences between simulation results may be due to differences in protein length, stability, and structure and because Ashenberg et al. consider many fewer substitutions and (contrary to their assertions) much shorter evolutionary times than did our simulations of more than 120,000 substitutions each. We support Ashenberg et al.'s call for greater focus on site-specific selective constraints in molecular evolution, but it is clear that temporal heterogeneity is also important. We need a better understanding of both.},

	abstract = {The process of amino acid replacement in proteins is context-dependent, with substitution rates influenced by local structure, functional role, and amino acids at other locations. Predicting how these differences affect replacement processes is difficult. To make such inference easier, it is often assumed that the acceptabilities of different amino acids at a position are constant. However, evolutionary interactions among residue positions will tend to invalidate this assumption. Here, we use simulations of purple acid phosphatase evolution to show that amino acid propensities at a position undergo predictable change after an amino acid replacement at that position. After a replacement, the new amino acid and similar amino acids tend to become gradually more acceptable over time at that position. In other words, proteins tend to equilibrate to the presence of an amino acid at a position through replacements at other positions. Such a shift is reminiscent of the spectroscopy effect known as the Stokes shift, where molecules receiving a quantum of energy and moving to a higher electronic state will adjust to the new state and emit a smaller quantum of energy whenever they shift back down to the original ground state. Predictions of changes in stability in real proteins show that mutation reversals become less favorable over time, and thus, broadly support our results. The observation of an evolutionary Stokes shift has profound implications for the study of protein evolution and the modeling of evolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {6.1 Introduction The field of molecular evolution, though wide-reaching in its breadth, can be split into two types of investigations: studies of phylogeny and studies of the molecular evolutionary process. Of course, each of these two categories en-compasses many different types of questions, and many investigations require studies of both phylogeny and evolutionary process, but the proposed binary classification is a useful construct. Software for molecular evolution is focused disproportionately on problems relating to phylogenetic reconstruction, with a number of outstanding comprehensive packages from which to choose. On the other hand, software for addressing questions of the molecular evolutionary process tends to be found in stand-alone programs that answer only one or two quite specific problems. The {HyPhy} system, available for download from www.hyphy.org, was designed to provide a unified platform for carrying out likelihood-based analyses on molecular evolutionary data sets, the emphasis of analyses being the molecular evolutionary process; that is, studies of rates and patterns of the evolution of molecular sequences. {HyPhy} consists of three major components: a high-level programming lan-guage designed to facilitate the rapid implementation of new statistical meth-ods for molecular evolutionary analysis; a collection of prewritten analyses for carrying out widely used molecular evolutionary methods; and a graphical user interface that allows users to quickly and interactively analyze data sets of aligned sequences using evolutionary models and statistical methods that they design using the software system. This chapter is intended to provide an overview of the key elements of each of the three system components, in-cluding both specific details of the basic functionality as well as a conceptual description of the potential uses of the software. The nature of the package prevents the creation of an exhaustive " cookbook " of available methods. In-stead, we hope to provide a collection of fundamental tools and concepts that allow users to begin using {HyPhy} to carry out both existing and new methods of data analysis. The second of the three enumerated {HyPhy} components was a collection of prewritten " standard " analyses. Since this section of the software is essen-tially just a collection of prepackaged analyses, we will not devote much time to a detailed discussion of it. However, we choose to describe it first in this chapter to illustrate the types of analyses that {HyPhy} has been designed to address. In Figure 6.1, we show the initial Standard Analyses menu invoked by Analyses:Standard Analyses... (note the use of Small Caps to indi-cate menu items, with submenus or selections separated by a colon). Each of the nine major headings includes a collection of routines that can be selected by the user. For example, the Positive Selection menu item expands to offer five different analyses relating to the task of identifying nucleotide sites undergoing positive selection. A total of 35 batch files are included in the col-lection, and most of these files include a variety of options enabling users to select items such as evolutionary models or topology search methods.

Prdm9 genes often exhibit substantial variation in their numbers of encoded zinc fingers ({ZFs}), not only between closely related species but also among individuals of a species. The near-identity of these {ZF} sequences appears to render them very unstable in copy number. The rare sequence differences, however, cluster within {ZF} sites that determine the {DNA}-binding specificity of {PRDM}9, and these substitutions are frequently positively selected. Here, possible drivers of the rapid evolution of Prdm9 are discussed, including selection for efficient pairing of homologous chromosomes or for recombination of deleterious linked alleles, and selection against depletion of recombination hotspots or against disease-associated genome rearrangement. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {After the effective size of a population, Ne, declines, some slightly deleterious amino acid replacements which were initially suppressed by purifying selection become effectively neutral and can reach fixation. Here we investigate this phenomenon for a set of all 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes from 110 mammalian species. By using body mass as a proxy for N e, we show that large mammals (i.e., those with low Ne) as compared with small ones (in our sample these are, on average, 369.5 kg and 275 g, respectively) have a 43\% higher rate of accumulation of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions relative to synonymous substitutions, and an 8-40\% higher rate of accumulation of radical amino acid substitutions relative to conservative substitutions, depending on the type of amino acid classification. These higher rates result in a 6\% greater amino acid dissimilarity between modern species and their most recent reconstructed ancestors in large versus small mammals. Because nonsynonymous substitutions are likely to be more harmful than synonymous substitutions, and radical amino acid substitutions are likely to be more harmful than conservative ones, our results suggest that large mammals experience less efficient purifying selection than small mammals. Furthermore, because in the course of mammalian evolution body size tends to increase and, consequently, Ne tends to decline, evolution of mammals toward large body size may involve accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations in mitochondrial protein-coding genes, which may contribute to decline or extinction of large mammals. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA}.},

Here we discuss some fundamental concepts and techniques of model selection in the context of phylogenetics. We start by reviewing different aspects of the selection of substitution models in phylogenetics from a theoretical, philosophical and practical point of view, and summarize this comparison in table format. We argue that the most commonly implemented model selection approach, the hierarchical likelihood ratio test, is not the optimal strategy for model selection in phylogenetics, and that approaches like the Akaike Information Criterion ({AIC}) and Bayesian methods offer important advantages. In particular, the latter two methods are able to simultaneously compare multiple nested or nonnested models, assess model selection uncertainty, and allow for the estimation of phylogenies and model parameters using all available models (model-averaged inference or multimodel inference). We also describe how the relative importance of the different parameters included in substitution models can be depicted. To illustrate some of these points, we have applied {AIC}-based model averaging to 37 mitochondrial {DNA} sequences from the subgenus Ohomopterus (genus Carabus) ground beetles described by Sota and Vogler (2001).},

Here, we extend this argument to consider its predictions for epistatic interactions for the effects of mutations on the free energy of folding. Although there is abundant evidence to indicate that the effects of mutations on the free energy of folding are nearly additive and conserved over evolutionary time, we show that these observations are compatible with the hypothesis that a non-additive contribution to the folding free energy is essential for observed proteins to maintain their native structure. In particular, through both simulations and analytical results, we show that even very small departures from additivity are sufficient to drive this effect.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {A major goal of molecular evolutionary biology is to identify loci or regions of the genome under selection versus those evolving in a neutral manner. Correct identification allows accurate inference of the evolutionary process and thus comprehension of historical and contemporary processes driving phenotypic change and adaptation. A fundamental difficulty lies in distinguishing sites targeted by selection from both sites linked to these targets and sites fully independent of selection. These three categories of sites necessitate attention in light of the debate over the relative importance of selection versus neutrality and the neutral theory. Modern genomic insights have proved that complex processes such as linkage, demography, and biased gene conversion complicate our understanding of the role of neutral versus selective processes in evolution. In this perspective, we first highlight the importance of the genomic and (a)biotic context of new mutations to identify the targets of natural selection. We then present mechanisms that may constrain the evolution of genomes and bias the inference of selection. We discuss these mechanisms within the two critical levels that they occur: the population level and the molecular level. We highlight that they should be taken into account to correctly distinguish sites across the genome subject to selective or non-selective forces and stress that a major current field-wide goal is to quantify the absolute importance of these mechanisms.},

We demonstrate here that {SCU} is not driven by constraints on {tRNA} abundance, but by large-scale variation in {GC}-content, caused by meiotic recombination, via the non-adaptive process of {GC}-biased gene conversion ({gBGC}). Expression in meiotic cells is associated with a strong decrease in recombination within genes. Differences in {SCU} among functional categories reflect differences in levels of meiotic transcription, which is linked to variation in recombination and therefore in {gBGC}. Overall, the {gBGC} model explains 70\% of the variance in {SCU} among genes.

One popular view proposes that mapping efforts should focus on identification of susceptibility mutations that are relatively old and at high frequency. It is generally assumed - at least for modeling purposes - that selection against complex disease mutations is so weak that it can be ignored. In this article, I propose an explicit model for the evolution of complex disease loci, incorporating mutation, random genetic drift, and the possibility of purifying selection against susceptibility mutations. I show that, for the most plausible range of mutation rates, neutral susceptibility alleles are unlikely to be at intermediate frequencies and contribute little to the overall genetic variance for the disease. Instead, it seems likely that the bulk of genetic variance underlying diseases is due to loci where susceptibility mutations are mildly deleterious and where there is a high overall mutation rate to the susceptible class. At such loci, the total frequency of susceptibility mutations may be quite high, but there is likely to be extensive allelic heterogeneity at many of these loci. I discuss some practical implications of these results for gene mapping efforts.},

Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci—e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

In this article, we review the available data and models relating to the number and frequencies of susceptibility alleles at complex disease loci - the 'allelic architecture' of human disease genes.

Here, we develop an approximation to the distribution of fitness effects ({DFE}) of segregating single-nucleotide mutations in humans. Unlike previous methods, we do not assume that synonymous mutations are neutral or not strongly selected, and we do not rely on fitting the {DFE} of all new nonsynonymous mutations to a single probability distribution, which is poorly motivated on a biological level. We rely on a previously developed method that utilizes a variety of published annotations (including conservation scores, protein deleteriousness estimates and regulatory data) to score all mutations in the human genome based on how likely they are to be affected by negative selection, controlling for mutation rate. We map this and other conservation scores to a scale of fitness coefficients via maximum likelihood using diffusion theory and a Poisson random field model on {SNP} data. Our method serves to approximate the deleterious {DFE} of mutations that are segregating, regardless of their genomic consequence. We can then compare the proportion of mutations that are negatively selected or neutral across various categories, including different types of regulatory sites. We observe that the distribution of intergenic polymorphisms is highly peaked at neutrality, while the distribution of nonsynonymous polymorphisms has a second peak at . Other types of polymorphisms have shapes that fall roughly in between these two. We find that transcriptional start sites, strong {CTCF}-enriched elements and enhancers are the regulatory categories with the largest proportion of deleterious polymorphisms.},

	abstract = {Background. Molecular sequence data have become the standard in modern day phylogenetics. In particular, several long-standing questions of mammalian evolutionary history have been recently resolved thanks to the use of molecular characters. Yet, most studies have focused on only a handful of standard markers. The availability of an ever increasing number of whole genome sequences is a golden mine for modern systematics. Genomic data now provide the opportunity to select new markers that are potentially relevant for further resolving branches of the mammalian phylogenetic tree at various taxonomic levels. Description. The {EnsEMBL} database was used to determine a set of orthologous genes from 12 available complete mammalian genomes. As targets for possible amplification and sequencing in additional taxa, more than 3,000 exons of length {\textbackslash}textgreater 400 bp have been selected, among which 118, 368, 608, and 674 are respectively retrieved for 12, 11, 10, and 9 species. A bioinformatic pipeline has been developed to provide evolutionary descriptors for these candidate markers in order to assess their potential phylogenetic utility. The resulting {OrthoMaM} (Orthologous Mammalian Markers) database can be queried and alignments can be downloaded through a dedicated web interface http://kimura.univ-montp2. fr/orthomam. Conclusion. The importance of marker choice in phylogenetic studies has long been stressed. Our database centered on complete genome information now makes possible to select promising markers to a given phylogenetic question or a systematic framework by querying a number of evolutionary descriptors. The usefulness of the database is illustrated with two biological examples. First, two potentially useful markers were identified for rodent systematics based on relevant evolutionary parameters and sequenced in additional species. Second, a complete, gapless 94 kb supermatrix of 118 orthologous exons was assembled for 12 mammals. Phylogenetic analyses using probabilistic methods unambiguously supported the new placental phylogeny by retrieving the monophyly of Glires, Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria, and Boreoeutheria. Muroid rodents thus do not represent a basal placental lineage as it was mistakenly reasserted in some recent phylogenomic analyses based on fewer taxa. We expect the {OrthoMaM} database to be useful for further resolving the phylogenetic tree of placental mammals and for better understanding the evolutionary dynamics of their genomes, i.e., the forces that shaped coding sequences in terms of selective constraints. © 2007 Ranwez et al; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {The identification of loci influenced by positive selection is a major goal of evolutionary genetics. A popular approach is to perform scans of alignments on a genome-wide scale in order to find regions evolving at accelerated rates on a particular branch of a phylogenetic tree. However, positive selection is not the only process that can lead to accelerated evolution. Notably, {GC}-biased gene conversion ({gBGC}) is a recombination-associated process that results in the biased fixation of G and C nucleotides. This process can potentially generate bursts of nucleotide substitutions within hotspots of meiotic recombination. Here, we analyse the results of a scan for positive selection on genes on branches across the primate phylogeny. We show that genes identified as targets of positive selection have a significant tendency to exhibit the genomic signature of {gBGC}. Using a maximum-likelihood framework, we estimate that more than 20 per cent of cases of significantly elevated non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates ratio (d(N)/d(S)), particularly in shorter branches, could be due to {gBGC}. We demonstrate that in some cases, {gBGC} can lead to very high d(N)/d(S) (more than 2). Our results indicate that {gBGC} significantly affects the evolution of coding sequences in primates, often leading to patterns of evolution that can be mistaken for positive selection.},

	abstract = {The protein misfolding avoidance hypothesis explains the universal negative correlation between protein abundance and sequence evolutionary rate across the proteome by identifying protein folding free energy (ΔG) as the confounding variable. Abundant proteins resist toxic misfolding events by being more stable, and more stable proteins evolve slower because their mutations are more destabilizing. Direct supporting evidence consists only of computer simulations. A study taking advantage of a recent experimental breakthrough in measuring protein stability proteome-wide through melting temperature (Tm) (Leuenberger et al. 2017), found weak misfolding avoidance hypothesis support for the Escherichia coli proteome, and no support for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, and Thermus thermophilus proteomes (Plata and Vitkup 2018). I find that the nontrivial relationship between Tm and ΔG and inaccuracy in Tm measurements by Leuenberger et al. 2017 can be responsible for not observing strong positive abundance–Tm and strong negative Tm–evolutionary rate correlations.},

	abstract = {The general theories of molecular evolution depend on relatively arbitrary assumptions about the relative distribution and rate of advantageous, deleterious, neutral, and nearly neutral mutations. The Fisher geometrical model ({FGM}) has been used to make distributions of mutations biologically interpretable. We explored an {FGM}-based molecular model to represent molecular evolutionary processes typically studied by nearly neutral and selection models, but in which distributions and relative rates of mutations with different selection coefficients are a consequence of biologically interpretable parameters, such as the average size of the phenotypic effect of mutations and the number of traits (complexity) of organisms. A variant of the {FGM}-based model that we called the static regime ({SR}) represents evolution as a nearly neutral process in which substitution rates are determ ined by a dynamic substitutionprocess in which the population's phenotype remains around a suboptimum equilibrium fitness produced by a balance between slightly deleterious and slightly advantageous compensatory substitutions. As in previous nearly neutral models, the {SR} predicts a negative relationship between molecular evolutionary rate and population size; however, {SR} does not have the unrealistic properties of previous nearly neutral models such as the narrow window of selection strengths in which they work. In addition, the {SR} suggests that compensatory mutations cannot explain the high rate of fixations driven by positive selection currently found in {DNA} sequences, contrary to what has been previously suggested. We also developed a generalization of {SR} in which the optimum phenotype can change stochastically due to environmental or physiological shifts, which we called the variable regime ({VR}). {VR} models evolution as an interplay between adaptive processes and nearly neutral steady-state processes. When strong environmental fluctuations are incorporated, the process becomes a selection model in which evolutionary rate does not depend on population size, but is critically dependent on the complexity of organisms and mutation size. For {SR} as well as {VR} we found that key parameters of molecular evolution are linked by biological factors, and we showed that they cannot be fixed independently by arbitrary criteria, as has usually been assumed in previous molecular evolutionary models. © 2012 by the Genetics Society of America.},

	abstract = {Models of codon substitution have been commonly used to compare protein-coding {DNA} sequences and are particularly effective in detecting signals of natural selection acting on the protein. Their utility in reconstructing molecular phylogenies and in dating species divergences has not been explored. Codon models naturally accommodate synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, which occur at very different rates and may be informative for recent and ancient divergences, respectively. Thus codon models may be expected to make an efficient use of phylogenetic information in protein-coding {DNA} sequences. Here we applied codon models to 106 protein-coding genes from eight yeast species to reconstruct phylogenies using the maximum likelihood method, in comparison with nucleotide- and amino acid–based analyses. The results appeared to confirm that expectation. Nucleotide-based analysis, under simplistic substitution models, were efficient in recovering recent divergences whereas amino acid–based analysis performed better at recovering deep divergences. Codon models appeared to combine the advantages of amino acid and nucleotide data and had good performance at recovering both recent and deep divergences. Estimation of relative species divergence times using amino acid and codon models suggested that translation of gene sequences into proteins led to information loss of from 30\% for deep nodes to 66\% for recent nodes. Although computational burden makes codon models unfeasible for tree search in large data sets, we suggest that they may be useful for comparing candidate trees. Nucleotide models that accommodate the differences in evolutionary dynamics at the three codon positions also performed well, at much less computational cost. We discuss the relationship between a model's fit to data and its utility in phylogeny reconstruction and caution against use of overly complex substitution models.},

	abstract = {In the history of life, some phenotypes have been acquired several times independently, through convergent evolution. Recently, lots of genome-scale studies have been devoted to identify nucleotides or amino acids that changed in a convergent manner when the convergent phenotypes evolved. These efforts have had mixed results, probably because of differences in the detection methods, and because of conceptual differences about the definition of a convergent substitution. Some methods contend that substitutions are convergent only if they occur on all branches where the phenotype changed toward the exact same state at a given nucleotide or amino acid position. Others are much looser in their requirements and define a convergent substitution as one that leads the site at which they occur to prefer a phylogeny in which species with the convergent phenotype group together. Here, we suggest to look for convergent shifts in amino acid preferences instead of convergent substitutions to the exact same amino acid. We define as convergent shifts substitutions that occur on all branches where the phenotype changed and such that they correspond to a change in the type of amino acid preferred at this position. We implement the corresponding model into a method named {PCOC}. We show on simulations that {PCOC} better recovers convergent shifts than existing methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We test it on a plant protein alignment where convergent evolution has been studied in detail and find that our method recovers several previously identified convergent substitutions and proposes credible new candidates.},

Among these, the protein's expression level, functional category, essentiality, or metabolic costs of its amino acid residues may play an important role. However, the relative importance of each variable has not yet been evaluated in comparative analyses. To this aim, we made regression analyses combining data available on these variables and on evolutionary rates, in two well-documented model bacteria, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. In both bacteria, the level of expression of the protein in the cell was by far the most important driving force constraining the amino acids substitution rate. Subsequent inclusion in the analysis of the other variables added little further information. Furthermore, when the rates of synonymous substitutions were included in the analysis of the E. coli data, only the variable expression levels remained statistically significant. The rate of nonsynonymous substitution was shown to correlate with expression levels independently of the rate of synonymous substitution. These results suggest an important direct influence of expression levels, or at least codon usage bias for translation optimization, on the rates of nonsynonymous substitutions in bacteria. They also indicate that when a control for this variable is included, essentiality plays no significant role in the rate of protein evolution in bacteria, as is the case in eukaryotes.},

Although these forces are "encoded" in the thousands of known protein structures, "decoding" them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational protein design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo designed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable designed proteins in four basic folds-a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6\% to 47\%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein design into a data-driven science.},

	abstract = {Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications},

Using this method, measures acting as sequence fitness proxies can be considered over a phylogenetic tree. In this work, a set of statistically derived amino acid pairwise potentials, developed in the context of protein threading, is used to account for what we call the structural fitness of a sequence.

Several variations and extensions to their models have since been proposed, but no general and flexible framework for contrasting the relative performance of alternative approaches has yet been applied. Here, we compute Bayes factors to evaluate the relative merit of several {MG} and {GY} styles of codon substitution models, including recent extensions acknowledging heterogeneous nonsynonymous rates across sites, as well as selective effects inducing uneven amino acid or codon preferences. Our results on three real data sets support a logical model construction following the {MG} formulation, allowing for a flexible account of global amino acid or codon preferences, while maintaining distinct parameters governing overall nucleotide propensities.

However, the approaches used to date have either focused on detecting global signals of adaptive regimes—across the entire gene—or on contexts where experimentally derived, site-specific amino acid fitness profiles are available. Here, we present a Bayesian site-heterogeneous mutation–selection framework for site-specific detection of adaptive substitution regimes given a protein-coding {DNA} alignment. We offer implementations, briefly present simulation results, and apply the approach on a few real data sets.

Descriptive models are often said to be phenomenologically motivated whereas explanatory models are said to be mechanistically motivated. In molecular evolutionary modeling the two approaches can typically be classified as dealing with either the inference of phylogenies - the phenomenological approach, lacking particular interest in evolutionary mechanisms per se, or focused on explaining the evolutionary process itself - the mechanistic approach. Here we emphasize that both phenomenological and mechanistic approaches are inherently present in any model. Focusing on the field of codon substitution modeling we point out that this area, traditionally viewed as being mechanistically motivated, has itself been imbued with phenomenological underpinnings. Using practical examples we stress that clarifying phenomenological and mechanistic motivations can help guide model developments, and suggest future work directions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Modeling the interplay between mutation and selection at the molecular level is key to evolutionary studies. To this end, codon-based evolutionary models have been proposed as pertinent means of studying long-range evolutionary patterns and are widely used. However, these approaches have not yet consolidated results from amino acid level phylogenetic studies showing that selection acting on proteins displays strong site-specific effects, which translate into heterogeneous amino acid propensities across the columns of alignments; related codon-level studies have instead focused on either modeling a single selective context for all codon columns, or a separate selective context for each codon column, with the former strategy deemed too simplistic and the latter deemed overparameterized. Here, we integrate recent developments in nonparametric statistical approaches to propose a probabilistic model that accounts for the heterogeneity of amino acid fitness profiles across the coding positions of a gene. We apply the model to a dozen real protein-coding gene alignments and find it to produce biologically plausible inferences, for instance, as pertaining to site-specific amino acid constraints, as well as distributions of scaled selection coefficients. In their account of mutational features as well as the heterogeneous regimes of selection at the amino acid level, the modeling approaches studied here can form a backdrop for several extensions, accounting for other selective features, for variable population size, or for subtleties of mutational features, all with parameterizations couched within population-genetic theory.},

This pivotal concept of population genetics has implications for species health, domestication, management and conservation. Levels of genetic diversity seem to vary greatly in natural populations and species, but the determinants of this variation, and particularly the relative influences of species biology and ecology versus population history, are still largely mysterious. Here we show that the diversity of a species is predictable, and is determined in the first place by its ecological strategy. We investigated the genome-wide diversity of 76 non-model animal species by sequencing the transcriptome of two to ten individuals in each species. The distribution of genetic diversity between species revealed no detectable influence of geographic range or invasive status but was accurately predicted by key species traits related to parental investment: long-lived or low-fecundity species with brooding ability were genetically less diverse than short-lived or highly fecund ones. Our analysis demonstrates the influence of long-term life-history strategies on species response to short-term environmental perturbations, a result with immediate implications for conservation policies.},

Detecting and characterizing the heterogeneity in time, and between lineages, of the nucleotide (or amino acid) substitution process is an important goal of current molecular evolutionary research. This task is typically achieved through the use of non-homogeneous models of sequence evolution, which being highly parametrized and computationally-demanding are not appropriate for large-scale analyses. Here we investigate an alternative methodological option based on probabilistic substitution mapping. The idea is to first reconstruct the substitutional history of each site of an alignment under a homogeneous model of sequence evolution, then to characterize variations in the substitution process across lineages based on substitution counts. Using simulated and published datasets, we demonstrate that probabilistic substitution mapping is robust in that it typically provides accurate reconstruction of sequence ancestry even when the true process is heterogeneous, but a homogeneous model is adopted. Consequently, we show that the new approach is essentially as efficient as and extremely faster than (up to 25 000 times) existing methods, thus paving the way for a systematic survey of substitution process heterogeneity across genes and lineages. © 2012 Romiguier et al.},

With this note, we announce the release of version 3.2, a major upgrade to the latest official release presented in 2003. The new version provides convergence diagnostics and allows multiple analyses to be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored on the fly. The introduction of new proposals and automatic optimization of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many problems. The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data extensions ({SSE}) and support of the {BEAGLE} library, allowing likelihood calculations to be delegated to graphics processing units ({GPUs}) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from around 2 with {SSE} code to more than 50 with {BEAGLE} for codon problems. Checkpointing across all models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is prematurely terminated. New models include relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across time-reversible substitution models, and support for hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the Bayesian estimation of species trees ({BEST}) algorithms. Marginal model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be estimated accurately across the entire model space using the stepping stone method. The new version provides more output options than previously, including samples of ancestral states, site rates, site {dN}/{dS} rations, branch rates, and node dates. A wide range of statistics on tree parameters can also be output for visualization in {FigTree} and compatible software. © 2012 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The rate of molecular evolution varies widely among species. Life history traits ({LHTs}) have been proposed as a major driver of these variations. However, the relative contribution of each trait is poorly understood. Here, we test the influence of metabolic rate ({MR}), longevity, and generation time ({GT}) on the nuclear and mitochondrial synonymous substitution rates using a group of isopod species that have made multiple independent transitions to subterranean environments. Subterranean species have repeatedly evolved a lower {MR}, a longer lifespan and a longer {GT}. We assembled the nuclear transcriptomes and the mitochondrial genomes of 13 pairs of closely related isopods, each pair composed of one surface and one subterranean species. We found that subterranean species have a lower rate of nuclear synonymous substitution than surface species whereas the mitochondrial rate remained unchanged. We propose that this decoupling between nuclear and mitochondrial rates comes from different {DNA} replication processes in these two compartments. In isopods, the nuclear rate is probably tightly controlled by {GT} alone. In contrast, mitochondrial genomes appear to replicate and mutate at a rate independent of {LHTs}. These results are incongruent with previous studies, which were mostly devoted to vertebrates. We suggest that this incongruence can be explained by developmental differences between animal clades, with a quiescent period during female gametogenesis in mammals and birds which imposes a nuclear and mitochondrial rate coupling, as opposed to the continuous gametogenesis observed in most arthropods.},

The accuracy of {NPRS} was examined by comparison to a clock-based maximum-likelihood method in computer simulations. {NPRS} provides more accurate estimates of divergence times when (1) sequence lengths are sufficiently long, (2) rates are truly nonclocklike, and (3) rates are moderately to highly autocorrelated in time.

The technique has been applied to the {DNA} of bacteriophage 4bX174 and is more rapid and more accurate than either the plus or the minus method. The "plus and minus" method (1) is a relatively rapid and simple technique that has made possible the determination of the sequence of the genome of bacteriophage 4X174 (2). It depends on the use of {DNA} polymerase to transcribe specific regions of the {DNA} under controlled conditions. Although the method is considerably more rapid and simple than other available techniques, neither the "plus" nor the "minus" method is completely accurate, and in order to establish a sequence both must be used together, and sometimes confirma-tory data are necessary. W. M. Barnes (J. Mol. Biol., in press) has recently developed a third method, involving ribo-substitution , which has certain advantages over the plus and minus method, but this has not yet been extensively exploited. Another rapid and simple method that depends on specific chemical degradation of the {DNA} has recently been described by Maxam and Gilbert (3), and this has also been used extensively for {DNA} sequencing. It has the advantage over the plus and minus method that it can be applied to double-stranded {DNA}, but it requires a strand separation or equivalent frac-tionation of each restriction enzyme fragment studied, which makes it somewhat more laborious.

	abstract = {The number of amino acids that occupy a given protein site during evolution reflects the selective constraints operating on the site. This evolutionary variability is strongly influenced by the structural properties of the site in the native structure, and it is quantified either through sequence entropy or through substitution rates. However, while the sequence entropy only depends on the equilibrium frequencies of the amino acids, the substitution rate also depends on the exchangeability matrix that describes mutations in the mathematical model of the substitution process. Here we apply two variants of a mathematical model of protein evolution with selection for protein stability, both against unfolding and against misfolding. Exploiting the approximation of independent sites, these models allow computing site-specific substitution processes that satisfy global constraints on folding stability. We find that site-specific substitution rates do not depend only on the selective constraints acting on the site, quantified through its sequence entropy. In fact, polar sites evolve faster than hydrophobic sites even for equal sequence entropy, as a consequence of the fact that polar amino acids are characterized by higher mutational exchangeability than hydrophobic ones. Accordingly, the model predicts that more polar proteins tend to evolve faster. Nevertheless, these results change if we compare proteins that evolve under different mutation biases, such as orthologous proteins in different bacterial genomes. In this case, the substitution rates are faster in genomes that evolve under mutational bias that favor hydrophobic amino acids by preferentially incorporating the nucleotide Thymine that is more frequent in hydrophobic codons. This appearingly contradictory result arises because buried sites occupied by hydrophobic amino acids are characterized by larger selective factors that largely amplify the substitution rate between hydrophobic amino acids, while the selective factors of exposed sites have a weaker effect. Thus, changes in the mutational bias produce deep effects on the biophysical properties of the protein (hydrophobicity) and on its evolutionary properties (sequence entropy and substitution rate) at the same time.

	abstract = {Thermodynamic data regarding proteins and their interactions are important for understanding the mechanisms of protein folding, protein stability, and molecular recognition. Although there are several structural databases available for proteins and their complexes with other molecules, databases for experimental thermodynamic data on protein stability and interactions are rather scarce. Thus, we have developed two electronically accessible thermodynamic databases. {ProTherm}, Thermodynamic Database for Proteins and Mutants, contains numerical data of several thermodynamic parameters of protein stability, experimental methods and conditions, along with structural, functional, and literature information. {ProNIT}, Thermodynamic Database for Protein-Nucleic Acid Interactions, contains thermodynamic data for protein-nucleic acid binding, experimental conditions, structural information of proteins, nucleic acids and the complex, and literature information. These data have been incorporated into 3DinSight, an integrated database for structure, function, and properties of biomolecules. A {WWW} interface allows users to search for data based on various conditions, with different display and sorting options, and to visualize molecular structures and their interactions. These thermodynamic databases, together with structural databases, help researchers gain insight into the relationship among structure, function, and thermodynamics of proteins and their interactions, and will become useful resources for studying proteins in the postgenomic era. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Protein structure mediates site-specific patterns of sequence divergence. In particular, residues in the core of a protein (solvent-inaccessible residues) tend to be more evolutionarily conserved than residues on the surface (solvent-accessible residues). Results: Here, we present a model of sequence evolution that explicitly accounts for the relative solvent accessibility of each residue in a protein. Our model is a variant of the Goldman-Yang 1994 ({GY}94) model in which all model parameters can be functions of the relative solvent accessibility ({RSA}) of a residue. We apply this model to a data set comprised of nearly 600 yeast genes, and find that an evolutionary-rate ratio \$ømega\$ that varies linearly with {RSA} provides a better model fit than an {RSA}-independent \$ømega\$ or an \$ømega\$ that is estimated separately in individual {RSA} bins. We further show that the branch length t and the transition-transverion ratio κ also vary with {RSA}. The {RSA}-dependent {GY}94 model performs better than an {RSA}-dependent Muse-Gaut 1994 ({MG}94) model in which the synonymous and non-synonymous rates individually are linear functions of {RSA}. Finally, protein core size affects the slope of the linear relationship between \$ømega\$ and {RSA}, and gene expression level affects both the intercept and the slope. Conclusions: Structure-aware models of sequence evolution provide a significantly better fit than traditional models that neglect structure. The linear relationship between \$ømega\$ and {RSA} implies that genes are better characterized by their \$ømega\$ slope and intercept than by just their mean \$ømega\$. © 2012 Scherrer et al.; licensee {BioMed} Central Ltd.},

The advantage of {revPoMo} is that an increase of sample size per species improves estimations but does not increase runtime.

We exemplify an analysis of a hundred species with ten haploid individuals each, showing that {PoMo} can perform inference on large data sets.

Analytical results that follow directly from this approach include the steady-state distribution of fixed genotypes and the load in finite populations. The analogy with statistical physics also reveals that, contrary to a basic tenet of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the frequencies of adaptive and deleterious substitutions at steady state are equal. Finally, just as the free energy function quantitatively characterizes the balance between energy and entropy, a free fitness function provides an analytical expression for the balance between natural selection and stochastic drift. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA}.},

Recent evidence from Drosophila, reviewed here, suggests that this view may be invalid. Analyses of genetic variation within and between species reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying selection, and thus of functional importance, and that a large fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are adaptive. The findings further indicate that, in Drosophila, adaptations may be both common and strong enough that the fate of neutral mutations depends on their chance linkage to adaptive mutations as much as on the vagaries of genetic drift. The emerging evidence has implications for a wide variety of fields, from conservation genetics to bioinformatics, and presents challenges to modelers and experimentalists alike. © 2009 Sella et al.},

Changes in effective population size or patterns of natural selection will mainly alter nonsynonymous substitution rates. Changes in generation length or mutation rates are likely to have an impact on both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates. By comparing changes in synonymous and nonsynonymous rates, the relative contributions of the driving forces of evolution can be better characterized. Here, we introduce a procedure for estimating the chronological rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions on the branches of an evolutionary tree. Because the widely used ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous rates is not designed to detect simultaneous increases or simultaneous decreases in synonymous and nonsynonymous rates, the estimation of these rates rather than their ratio can improve characterization of the evolutionary process. With our Bayesian approach, we analyze cytochrome oxidase subunit I evolution in primates and infer that nonsynonymous rates have a greater tendency to change over time than do synonymous rates. Our analysis of these data also suggests that rates have been positively correlated.},

Moreover, vitamin B6 sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis induction by distinct types of physical and chemical stress, including multiple chemotherapeutics. This effect requires pyridoxal kinase ({PDXK}), the enzyme that generates the bioactive form of vitamin B6. In line with a general role of vitamin B6 in stress responses, low {PDXK} expression levels were found to be associated with poor disease outcome in two independent cohorts of patients with {NSCLC}.

A better understanding of symmetry and an appreciation for its essential role in the genetic code formation can improve our understanding of nature's coding processes. Thus, it is worth formulating a new integrated symmetrical table for genetic codes, which is presented in this paper.

Despite the importance of a protein's structure and conformational dynamics to its function and thus its fitness, common phylogenetic methods embody minimal biophysical knowledge of proteins. To underscore the biophysical constraints on natural selection, we survey effects of protein mutations, highlighting the physical basis for marginal stability of natural globular proteins and how requirement for kinetic stability and avoidance of misfolding and misinteractions might have affected protein evolution. The biophysical underpinnings of these effects have been addressed by models with an explicit coarse-grained spatial representation of the polypeptide chain. Sequence-structure mappings based on such models are powerful conceptual tools that rationalize mutational robustness, evolvability, epistasis, promiscuous function performed by 'hidden' conformational states, resolution of adaptive conflicts and conformational switches in the evolution from one protein fold to another. Recently, protein biophysics has been applied to derive more accurate evolutionary accounts of sequence data. Methods have also been developed to exploit sequence-based evolutionary information to predict biophysical behaviours of proteins. The success of these approaches demonstrates a deep synergy between the fields of protein biophysics and protein evolution.},

Recently, {AlphaGo} became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in {AlphaGo} evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. {AlphaGo} becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict {AlphaGo}'s own move selections and also the winner of {AlphaGo}'s games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program {AlphaGo} Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100-0 against the previously published, champion-defeating {AlphaGo}.},

	abstract = {Current phylogenomic methods are still a long way from implementing a realistic genome evolu- tion model. An ideal approach would require a general joint analysis of genomic sequences, while including coding sequence annotation, protein evolution or gene transfer, among other mech- anisms, to infer the complete evolutionary history of the studied genomes. Such an approach is computationally intractable and currently approximated by phylogenomic pipelines that im- plement a series of independent steps ranging from gene annotation to species tree inference or positive selection detection. Here we review the virtues and limits of current phylogenomic meth- ods compared to what could be expected from an ideal method. We present five case studies to illustrate various issues and limits in current phylogenomic practices, while assessing their relative importance. We argue that data error is pervasive in modern datasets and models are still too simplistic compared to the complexity of biological and evolutionary processes. Im- portantly, joint analyses should be a research focus as the many steps of phylogenomic pipelines are not mutually independent. It is essential to recognize the hidden assumptions of the many types of analysis available to our community so as to circumvent model misspecifications and critically evaluate the relevance of their results. In conclusion, the quality of datasets should be enhanced via numerous, rigorous checkpoints, while also boosting the capability of models to handle biological complexity by the development of better models, particularly through joint analyses.},

	abstract = {Summary Resolving the early diversification of animal lineages has proven difficult, even using genome-scale datasets. Several phylogenomic studies have supported the classical scenario in which sponges (Porifera) are the sister group to all other animals (“Porifera-sister” hypothesis), consistent with a single origin of the gut, nerve cells, and muscle cells in the stem lineage of eumetazoans (bilaterians + ctenophores + cnidarians). In contrast, several other studies have recovered an alternative topology in which ctenophores are the sister group to all other animals (including sponges). The “Ctenophora-sister” hypothesis implies that eumetazoan-specific traits, such as neurons and muscle cells, either evolved once along the metazoan stem lineage and were then lost in sponges and placozoans or evolved at least twice independently in Ctenophora and in Cnidaria + Bilateria. Here, we report on our reconstruction of deep metazoan relationships using a 1,719-gene dataset with dense taxonomic sampling of non-bilaterian animals that was assembled using a semi-automated procedure, designed to reduce known error sources. Our dataset outperforms previous metazoan gene superalignments in terms of data quality and quantity. Analyses with a best-fitting site-heterogeneous evolutionary model provide strong statistical support for placing sponges as the sister-group to all other metazoans, with ctenophores emerging as the second-earliest branching animal lineage. Only those methodological settings that exacerbated long-branch attraction artifacts yielded Ctenophora-sister. These results show that methodological issues must be carefully addressed to tackle difficult phylogenetic questions and pave the road to a better understanding of how fundamental features of animal body plans have emerged.},

	title = {Tempo and mode in evolution},
	isbn = {0-231-05847-0},
	abstract = {It would be interesting to discover how far the present widespread acceptance of neo-Darwinism " is due to the expository brilliance of its protagonists, in particular to Morgan, J. ; B. S. Haldane, ' Huxley, Dobzhansky, Waddington and Mayr. No scientific theory in recent years has had the services of such a devoted following, and even a cursory reading of Dr Simpson's book is enough to show that here is another addition to the imposing series of neo-Darwinian classics. In contrast to preceding writers, Dr Simpson brings to his aid a profound knowledge of palaeo-zoology, a study that geneticists have tended to regard askance as a perennial source of neo-Lamarckian speculation. Such distrust Dr Simpson has probably allayed once and for all. The author's principal aim has been to show the thorough-going concordance between palaeontology and neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory, and he has performed this task with a high degree of success. The principal difficulty in harmonizing the data of palaeontology and neo-Darwinian genetics has always been the fact that the fossil record does not show that uniform, gradually differentiating" genealogical progression that many evolutionists would have expected. Moreover, there are significant gaps between most of the higher systematic categories. Dr Simpson deals thoroughly with these topics, and puts the whole discussion on a more precise plane by his analysis of evolution with regard to rate. He recognizes three main categories of evolution from this point of view: horotely, evolution proceeding at standard rate; bradytely, the extremely slow evolution of such well-known forms as Lingula; and tachytely, abnormally fast evolution. Such are the categories of evolution from the point of view of tempo. Three modes of evolution are likewise recognized: speciation, the splitting of an ancestral population into two or more divergent groups; phyletic evohition, the change during time of a whole single genetic population; and quantum evolution, the process that gives rise to new systematic groups. Each of the evolutionary categories thus recognized are discussed by the author in the light of neo-Darwinian theory, and he concludes that no evolutionary category is inexplicable according to the principles of .this theory. Goldschmidt's distinction between micro-evolution and macro-evolution is believed to be unreal, and it is shown that there are better grounds for distinguishing between both of Goldschruidt's categories and mega-evolution, the process whereby the major taxonomic classes are differentiated. In his discussion of the causes of bradytely, the author suggests that bradytelic forms may remain such through an unusually high degree of adaptation to their environment. Furthermore, and less satisfactorily, it is thought probable that bradytelic species exist in large populations even though such a famous example as Laiimeria is only known from a single individual. It is admittedly difficult to account for bradytely along standard neo-Darwinian lines unless large populations are involved, but the evidence for this assumption is not satisfactory. Difficulties also occur on the topic of orthogenesis or evolutionary momentum. In common with other neo-Darwinists, Dr Simpson attempts to explain all the cases quoted in terms of the direct or indirect operation of natural selection. Such explanations commend themselves on the grounds of theoretical simplicity, yet it must be recognized that the. evidence in their favour is only slight. On the other hand, it is almost impossible, by experimental methods, to rule out the oossibility of such an operation. The whole situation is parallel to the polygene controversy; the neo-Darwinian theory of evolutionary momentum and the explanation of blending inheritance in terms of polygene interaction both cover the facts, but would do so even though the theories were erroneous. That is to say, at the present moment these two theories both lack an adequate means of verification and an adequate means of possible rebuttal. third controversial matter in which the author makes a valuable contribution is the question of the origin of the higher systematic groups. There has been a tendency on the part of genetists to minimize the importance of the fact that practically every large class of organisms has arisen suddenly in the fossil record with no intermediate forms linking it to its putative ancestor. Dr Simpson does well to emphasize the significance and regularity of these gaps, and he condudes that a particular mode of evolution, quantum evolution, must be invoked to cover these occurrences, though it is held that this evolutionary mode still falls within the field of neo-Darwinian theory. It is impossible, in a short review, to do justice to the closely knit reasoning that the author has put into this extremely valuable work. Dr Simpson has certainly performed a most signal service to neo-Darwinism in elucidating what has been one of its weaker sides, the interpretation of the details of the fossil record. It is, of course, evident that there is still much research to be done before many tenets of the neo-Darwinian position can hold more than a speculative value. The role of natural selection is still more a matter of opinion than experiment; the causes of bradytely, quantum evolution, and the nature of evolutionary momentum and evolution towards extinction still remain obscure in spite of Dr Simpson's clarification; and it is becoming increasingly obvious that the notion of random mutation is merely camouflaging the least satisfactory side of the neo-Darwinian theory. The present volume will probably become the standard exposition of neo-Darwinism from the palaeontological angle.},

Parallel patterns of compositional bias were found within the archaea and the eubacteria.

The vertices of each simplex define objectively four nearest neighbor C(α) atoms, i.e., four nearest-neighbor residues. A simplex classification scheme is introduced in which simplices are divided into five classes based on the relative positions of vertex residues in protein primary sequence. Statistical analysis of the residue composition of Delaunay simplices reveals nonrandom preferences for certain quadruplets of amino acids to be clustered together. This nonrandom preference may be used to develop a four-body potential that can be used in evaluating sequence-structure compatibility for the purpose of inverted structure prediction.},

Similarly, the gene expression and expression breadth in sequences with signatures of purifying selection were higher than those of sequences with positive selective signatures.

	abstract = {The relative evolutionary rates at individual sites in proteins are informative measures of conservation or adaptation. Often used as evolutionarily aware conservation scores, relative rates reveal key functional or strongly selected residues. Estimating rates in a phylogenetic context requires specifying a protein substitution model, which is typically a phenomenological model trained on a large empirical data set. A strong emphasis has traditionally been placed on selecting the “best-fit” model, with the implicit understanding that suboptimal or otherwise ill-fitting models might bias inferences. However, the pervasiveness and degree of such bias has not been systematically examined. We investigated how model choice impacts site-wise relative rates in a large set of empirical protein alignments. We compared models designed for use on any general protein, models designed for specific domains of life, and the simple equal-rates Jukes Cantor-style model ({JC}). As expected, information theoretic measures showed overwhelming evidence that some models fit the data decidedly better than others. By contrast, estimates of site-specific evolutionary rates were impressively insensitive to the substitution model used, revealing an unexpected degree of robustness to potential model misspecification. A deeper examination of the fewer than 5\% of sites for which model inferences differed in a meaningful way showed that the {JC} model could uniquely identify rapidly evolving sites that models with empirically derived exchangeabilities failed to detect. We conclude that relative protein rates appear robust to the applied substitution model, and any sensible model of protein evolution, regardless of its fit to the data, should produce broadly consistent evolutionary rates.},

The performances of these two approaches have been well studied in the specific context of proper model specification, i.e., when the inference model matches the simulation model. By contrast, the relative performances of one-rate vs. two-rate parameterizations when applied to data generated according to a different mechanism remain unclear. Here, we compare the relative merits of one-rate and two-rate approaches in the specific context of model misspecification by simulating alignments with mutation–selection models rather than with {dN}={dS}-based models. We find that one-rate frameworks generally infer more accurate {dN}={dS} point estimates, even when {dS} varies among sites. In other words, modeling {dS} variation may substantially reduce accuracy of {dN}={dS} point estimates. These results appear to depend on the selective constraint operating at a given site. For sites under strong purifying selection ({dN}={dS} ≲ 0:3), one-rate and two-rate models show comparable performances. However, one-rate models significantly outperform two-rate models for sites under moderate-to-weak purifying selection. We attribute this distinction to the fact that, for these more quickly evolving sites, a given substitution is more likely to be nonsynonymous than synonymous. The data will therefore be relatively enriched for nonsynonymous changes, and modeling {dS} contributes excessive noise to {dN}={dS} estimates. We additionally find that high levels of divergence among sequences, rather than the number of sequences in the alignment, are more critical for obtaining precise point estimates.},

Two computationally tractable mutation-selection inference frameworks have been introduced: One framework employs a fixed-effects, highly parameterized maximum likelihood approach, whereas the other employs a random-effects Bayesian Dirichlet Process approach. While both implementations follow the same model, they appear to make distinct predictions about the distribution of selection coefficients. The fixed-effects framework estimates a large proportion of highly deleterious substitutions, whereas the random-effects framework estimates that all substitutions are either nearly neutral or weakly deleterious. It remains unknown, however, how accurately each method infers evolutionary constraints at individual sites. Indeed, selection coefficient distributions pool all site-specific inferences, thereby obscuring a precise assessment of site-specific estimates. Therefore, in this study, we use a simulation-based strategy to determine how accurately each approach recapitulates the selective constraint at individual sites. We find that the fixed-effects approach, despite its extensive parameterization, consistently and accurately estimates site-specific evolutionary constraint. By contrast, the random-effects Bayesian approach systematically underestimates the strength of natural selection, particularly for slowly evolving sites. We also find that, despite the strong differences between their inferred selection coefficient distributions, the fixed- and random-effects approaches yield surprisingly similar inferences of site-specific selective constraint. We conclude that the fixed-effects mutation-selection framework provides the more reliable software platform for model application and future development.},

Here we describe an emerging picture of pervasive epistasis in which the physical and biological effects of mutations change over the course of evolution in a lineage-specific fashion. Epistasis can restrict the trajectories available to an evolving protein or open new paths to sequences and functions that would otherwise have been inaccessible. We describe two broad classes of epistatic interactions, which arise from different physical mechanisms and have different effects on evolutionary processes. Specific epistasis—in which one mutation influences the phenotypic effect of few other mutations—is caused by direct and indirect physical interactions between mutations, which nonadditively change the protein's physical properties, such as conformation, stability, or affinity for ligands. In contrast, nonspecific epistasis describes mutations that modify the effect of many others; these typically behave additively with respect to the physical properties of a protein but exhibit epistasis because of a nonlinear relationship between the physical properties and their biological effects, such as function or fitness. Both types of interaction are rampant, but specific epistasis has stronger effects on the rate and outcomes of evolution, because it imposes stricter constraints and modulates evolutionary potential more dramatically; it therefore makes evolution more contingent on low-probability historical events and leaves stronger marks on the sequences, structures, and functions of protein families.},

	abstract = {Evolvability - the capacity to generate beneficial heritable variation - is a central property of biological systems. However, its origins and modulation by environmental factors have not been examined systematically. Here, we analyze the fitness effects of all single mutations in {TEM}-1 β-lactamase (4,997 variants) under selection for the wild-type function (ampicillin resistance) and for a new function (cefotaxime resistance). Tolerance to mutation in this enzyme is bimodal and dependent on the strength of purifying selection in vivo, a result that derives from a steep non-linear ampicillin-dependent relationship between biochemical activity and fitness. Interestingly, cefotaxime resistance emerges from mutations that are neutral at low levels of ampicillin but deleterious at high levels; thus the capacity to evolve new function also depends on the strength of selection. The key property controlling evolvability is an excess of enzymatic activity relative to the strength of selection, suggesting that fluctuating environments might select for high-activity enzymes. {PaperClip}},

Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events.

Combined with prior results, these estimates provide the basis for a potentially unifying explanation for the wide range in mutation rates that exists among organisms. Natural selection appears to reduce the mutation rate of a species to a level that scales negatively with both the effective population size (Ne), which imposes a drift barrier to the evolution of molecular refinements, and the genomic content of coding {DNA}, which is proportional to the target size for deleterious mutations. As a consequence of an expansion in genome size, some microbial eukaryotes with large Ne appear to have evolved mutation rates that are lower than those known to occur in prokaryotes, but multicellular eukaryotes have experienced elevations in the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate because of substantial reductions in Ne.},

Sometimes, through reassortment or through whole host shift events, genetic material from waterfowl viruses is introduced into the human population causing worldwide pandemics. Identifying which mutations allow viruses from avian origin to spread successfully in the human population is of great importance in predicting and controlling influenza pandemics. Here we describe a novel approach to identify such mutations. We use a sitewise non-homogeneous phylogenetic model that explicitly takes into account differences in the equilibrium frequencies of amino acids in different hosts and locations. We identify 172 amino acid sites with strong support and 518 sites with moderate support of different selection constraints in human and avian viruses. The sites that we identify provide an invaluable resource to experimental virologists studying adaptation of avian flu viruses to the human host. Identification of the sequence changes necessary for host shifts would help us predict the pandemic potential of various strains. The method is of broad applicability to investigating changes in selective constraints when the timing of the changes is known.},

Classifying these changes by their physicochemical properties has not been suitably effective in isolating the fastest evolving classes of changes. We now propose to use the Universal index U of Tang et al. (2004) to classify the 75 elementary amino acid changes (codons differing by 1 bp) by their evolutionary exchangeability. Let Ki denote the Ka value of each class (i = 1, {\textbackslash}ldots, 75 from the most to the least exchangeable). The cumulative Ki for the top 10 classes, denoted Kh (for high-exchangeability types), has two important properties: (1) Kh usually accounts for 25\%–30\% of total amino acid changes and (2) when the observed number of amino acid substitutions is large, Kh is predictably twice the value of Ka. This shall be referred to as the twofold approximation. The new method for estimating Kh is applied to the comparisons between human and macaque and between mouse and rat. The twofold approximation holds well in these data sets, and the signature of positive selection can be more easily discerned using the Kh statistic than using Ka. Many genes with Ka/Ks {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.5 can now be shown to have Kh/Ks {\textbackslash}textgreater 1 and to have evolved adaptively, at least for the high-exchangeability group of amino acid changes.},

	abstract = {The possible evolutionary trajectories a population can follow is determined by the fitness effects of new mutations. Their relative frequencies are best specified through a distribution of fitness effects ({DFE}) that spans deleterious, neutral, and beneficial mutations. As such, the {DFE} is key to several aspects of the evolution of a population, and particularly the rate of adaptive molecular evolution (α). Inference of {DFE} from patterns of polymorphism and divergence has been a longstanding goal of evolutionary genetics. {polyDFE} provides a flexible statistical framework to estimate the {DFE} and α from site frequency spectrum ({SFS}) data. Several probability distributions can be fitted to the data to model the {DFE}. The method also jointly estimates a series of nuisance parameters that model the effect of unknown demography as well data imperfections, in particular possible errors in polarizing {SNPs}. This chapter is organized as a tutorial for {polyDFE}. We start by briefly reviewing the concept of {DFE}, α, and the principles underlying the method, and then provide an example using central chimpanzees data (Tataru et al., Genetics 207(3):1103–1119, 2017; Bataillon et al., Genome Biol Evol 7(4):1122–1132, 2015) to guide the user through the different steps of an analysis: formatting the data as input to {polyDFE}, fitting different models, obtaining estimates of parameters uncertainty and performing statistical tests, as well as model averaging procedures to obtain robust estimates of model parameters.},

It conditions the evolutionary trajectory of populations, as well as the rate of adaptive molecular evolution (α). Inferring {DFE} and α from patterns of polymorphism, as given through the site frequency spectrum ({SFS}) and divergence data, has been a longstanding goal of evolutionary genetics. A widespread assumption shared by previous inference methods is that beneficial mutations only contribute negligibly to the polymorphism data. Hence, a {DFE} comprising only deleterious mutations tends to be estimated from {SFS} data, and α is then predicted by contrasting the {SFS} with divergence data from an outgroup. We develop a hierarchical probabilistic framework that extends previous methods to infer {DFE} and α from polymorphism data alone. We use extensive simulations to examine the performance of our method. While an outgroup is still needed to obtain an unfolded {SFS}, we show that both a {DFE}, comprising both deleterious and beneficial mutations, and α can be inferred without using divergence data. We also show that not accounting for the contribution of beneficial mutations to polymorphism data leads to substantially biased estimates of the {DFE} and α. We compare our framework with one of the most widely used inference methods available and apply it on a recently published chimpanzee exome data set.},

The most common interpretation is that proteins must be marginally stable in order to function, and so marginal stability represents the results of positive selection. We consider the issue of marginal stability directly using model proteins and the dynamical aspects of protein evolution in populations. We find that the marginal stability of proteins is an inherent property of proteins due to the high dimensionality of the sequence space, without regard to protein function. In this way, marginal stability can result from neutral, non-adaptive evolution. By allowing evolving protein sub-populations with different stability requirements for functionality to complete, we find that marginally stable populations of proteins tend to dominate. Our results show that functionalities consistent with marginal stability have a strong evolutionary advantage, and might arise because of the natural tendency of proteins towards marginal stability.

However, in many cases we are interested in directional selection where there is a shift toward specific amino acids, resulting in increased fitness in the species. Recently, a few methods have been developed to detect and characterize directional selection on a molecular level. Using the results of evolutionary simulations as well as {HIV} drug resistance data as models of directional selection, we compare two such methods with each other, as well as against a standard method for detecting diversifying selection. We find that the method to detect diversifying selection also detects directional selection under certain conditions. One method developed for detecting directional selection is powerful and accurate for a wide range of conditions, while the other can generate an excessive number of false positives.},

	abstract = {Recent work indicates that allelic incompatibility in the mouse {PRDM}9 (Meisetz) gene can cause hybrid male sterility, contributing to genetic isolation and potentially speciation. The only phenotype of mouse {PRDM}9 knockouts is a meiosis I block that causes sterility in both sexes. The {PRDM}9 gene encodes a protein with histone H3(K4) trimethyltransferase activity, a {KRAB} domain, and a {DNA}-binding domain consisting of multiple tandem C2H2 zinc finger ({ZF}) domains. We have analyzed human coding polymorphism and interspecies evolutionary changes in the {PRDM}9 gene. The {ZF} domains of {PRDM}9 are evolving very rapidly, with compelling evidence of positive selection in primates. Positively selected amino acids are predominantly those known to make nucleotide specific contacts in C2H2 zinc fingers. These results suggest that {PRDM}9 is subject to recurrent selection to change {DNA}-binding specificity. The human {PRDM}9 protein is highly polymorphic in its {ZF} domains and nearly all polymorphisms affect the same nucleotide contact residues that are subject to positive selection. {ZF} domain nucleotide sequences are strongly homogenized within species, indicating that interfinger recombination contributes to their evolution. {PRDM}9 has previously been assumed to be a transcription factor required to induce meiosis specific genes, a role that is inconsistent with its molecular evolution. We suggest instead that {PRDM}9 is involved in some aspect of centromere segregation conflict and that rapidly evolving centromeric {DNA} drives changes in {PRDM}9 {DNA}-binding domains. © 2009 Thomas et al.},

	abstract = {Big, time-scaled phylogenies are fundamental to connecting evolutionary processes to modern biodiversity patterns. Yet inferring reliable phylogenetic trees for thousands of species involves numerous trade-offs that have limited their utility to comparative biologists. To establish a robust evolutionary timescale for all approximately 6,000 living species of mammals, we developed credible sets of trees that capture root-to-tip uncertainty in topology and divergence times. Our “backbone-and-patch” approach to tree building applies a newly assembled 31-gene supermatrix to two levels of Bayesian inference: (1) backbone relationships and ages among major lineages, using fossil node or tip dating, and (2) species-level “patch” phylogenies with nonoverlapping in-groups that each correspond to one representative lineage in the backbone. Species unsampled for {DNA} are either excluded (“{DNA}-only” trees) or imputed within taxonomic constraints using branch lengths drawn from local birth–death models (“completed” trees). Joining time-scaled patches to backbones results in species-level trees of extant Mammalia with all branches estimated under the same modeling framework, thereby facilitating rate comparisons among lineages as disparate as marsupials and placentals. We compare our phylogenetic trees to previous estimates of mammal-wide phylogeny and divergence times, finding that (1) node ages are broadly concordant among studies, and (2) recent (tip-level) rates of speciation are estimated more accurately in our study than in previous “supertree” approaches, in which unresolved nodes led to branch-length artifacts. Credible sets of mammalian phylogenetic history are now available for download at http://vertlife.org/phylosubsets, enabling investigations of long-standing questions in comparative biology.},

To identify genes underlying salivary gland functional diversification, we sequenced submandibular gland transcriptomes from phyllostomid species representative of divergent dietary strategies. From the assembled transcriptomes, we performed an array of selection tests and gene expression analyses to identify signatures of adaptation. Overall, we identified an enrichment of immunity related gene ontology terms among 53 genes evolving under positive selection. Lineage specific selection tests revealed several endomembrane system genes under selection in the vampire bat. Many genes that respond to insulin were under selection and differentially expressed genes pointed to modifications of amino acid synthesis pathways in plant-visitors.

What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded–game theory–has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences. This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the New York Times, tthe American Economic Review, and a variety of other publications.

	abstract = {Background: Mammalian genome sequence data are being acquired in large quantities and at enormous speeds. We now have a tremendous opportunity to better understand which genes are the most variable or conserved, and what their particular functions and evolutionary dynamics are, through comparative genomics.Results: We chose human and eleven other high-coverage mammalian genome data-as well as an avian genome as an outgroup-to analyze orthologous protein-coding genes using nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates. After evaluating eight commonly-used methods of Ka and Ks calculation, we observed that these methods yielded a nearly uniform result when estimating Ka, but not Ks (or Ka/Ks). When sorting genes based on Ka, we noticed that fast-evolving and slow-evolving genes often belonged to different functional classes, with respect to species-specificity and lineage-specificity. In particular, we identified two functional classes of genes in the acquired immune system. Fast-evolving genes coded for signal-transducing proteins, such as receptors, ligands, cytokines, and {CDs} (cluster of differentiation, mostly surface proteins), whereas the slow-evolving genes were for function-modulating proteins, such as kinases and adaptor proteins. In addition, among slow-evolving genes that had functions related to the central nervous system, neurodegenerative disease-related pathways were enriched significantly in most mammalian species. We also confirmed that gene expression was negatively correlated with evolution rate, i.e. slow-evolving genes were expressed at higher levels than fast-evolving genes. Our results indicated that the functional specializations of the three major mammalian clades were: sensory perception and oncogenesis in primates, reproduction and hormone regulation in large mammals, and immunity and angiotensin in rodents.Conclusion: Our study suggests that Ka calculation, which is less biased compared to Ks and Ka/Ks, can be used as a parameter to sort genes by evolution rate and can also provide a way to categorize common protein functions and define their interaction networks, either pair-wise or in defined lineages or subgroups. Evaluating gene evolution based on Ka and Ks calculations can be done with large datasets, such as mammalian genomes.Reviewers: This article has been reviewed by Drs.

	abstract = {There is considerable variation in the rate at which different proteins evolve. Why is this? Classically, it has been considered that the density of functionally important sites must predict rates of protein evolution. Likewise, amino acid choice is usually assumed to reflect optimal protein function. In the present article, we briefly review evidence suggesting that this protein function-centred view is too simplistic. In particular, we concentrate on how selection acting during the protein's production history can also affect protein evolutionary rates and amino acid choice. Exploring the role of selection at the {DNA} and {RNA} level, we specifically address how the need (i) to specify exonic splice enhancer motifs in pre-{mRNA}, and (ii) to ensure nucleosome positioning on {DNA} have an impact on amino acid choice and rates of evolution. For both, we review evidence that sequence affected by more than one coding demand is particularly constrained. Strikingly, in mammals, splicing-related constraints are quantitatively as important as expression parameters in predicting rates of protein evolution. These results indicate that there is substantially more to protein evolution than protein functional constraints. © The Authors Journal compilation. © 2009 Biochemical Society.},

	abstract = {Natural selection drives evolving populations up the fitness landscape, the projection from nucleotide sequence space to organismal reproductive success. While it has long been appreciated that topographic complexities on fitness landscapes can arise only as a consequence of epistatic interactions between mutations, evolutionary genetics has mainly focused on epistasis between pairs of mutations. Here we propose a generalization to the classical population genetic treatment of pairwise epistasis that yields expressions for epistasis among arbitrary subsets of mutations of all orders (pairwise, three-way, etc.). Our approach reveals substantial higher-order epistasis in almost every published fitness landscape. Furthermore we demonstrate that higher-order epistasis is critically important in two systems we know best. We conclude that higher-order epistasis deserves empirical and theoretical attention from evolutionary geneticists. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This means that parameter estimation can require numerical integration, and this can be computationally costly and inaccurate. Furthermore, the leading parameter dependencies of important quantities can be unclear, making results difficult to understand. For some commonly used distributions of mutant effects, we show how these problems can be avoided by writing equations in terms of special functions. Series expansion then allows for their rapid calculation and, also, illuminates leading parameter dependencies. For example, we show that if mutants are gamma distributed, the neutrality index is largely independent of the effective population size. However, we also show that such results are not robust to misspecification of the functional form of distribution. Some implications of these findings are then discussed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC}.},

	abstract = {Eusociality is a rare life history strategy that evolved repeatedly in Hymenoptera. At the population genetics level, inbreeding and low effective population size have been suggested as both evolutionary causes and consequences of social life. In this study, we tested these hypotheses by estimating the relative rate of non-synonymous substitution in 169 species to investigate the variation in natural selection efficiency and effective population size throughout the Hymenoptera tree of life. We show that relaxed selection is strongly associated with eusociality. This suggests that the division of reproductive labour decreases effective population size in ants, bees and wasps. Interestingly, we also report a striking and widespread relaxation of selection in both social and non social bees, which indicates that these keystone pollinator species generally feature low effective population sizes. We suggest that a particularly high inbreeding rate in bees might increase the benefits of kin selection, which would explain why most independent origins of eusociality in the tree of life occurred in this taxon. The particularly high load of deleterious mutations we report in the genome of these crucial ecosystem engineer species suggest new concerns about their ongoing population decline. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The phylogenetic inference of ancestral protein sequences is a powerful technique for the study of molecular evolution, but any conclusions drawn from such studies are only as good as the accuracy of the reconstruction method. Every inference method leads to errors in the ancestral protein sequence, resulting in potentially misleading estimates of the ancestral protein's properties. To assess the accuracy of ancestral protein reconstruction methods, we performed computational population evolution simulations featuring near-neutral evolution under purifying selection, speciation, and divergence using an off-lattice protein model where fitness depends on the ability to be stable in a specified target structure. We were thus able to compare the thermodynamic properties of the true ancestral sequences with the properties of "ancestral sequences" inferred by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Surprisingly, we found that methods such as maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood that reconstruct a "best guess" amino acid at each position overestimate thermostability, while a Bayesian method that sometimes chooses less-probable residues from the posterior probability distribution does not. Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony apparently tend to eliminate variants at a position that are slightly detrimental to structural stability simply because such detrimental variants are less frequent. Other properties of ancestral proteins might be similarly overestimated. This suggests that ancestral reconstruction studies require greater care to come to credible conclusions regarding functional evolution. Inferred functional patterns that mimic reconstruction bias should be reevaluated. © 2006 Williams et al.},

	abstract = {Mutualistic, maternally transmitted endosymbiotic microorganisms undergo severe population bottlenecks at each host generation, resulting in a reduction in effective population size (Ne). Previous studies of Buchnera, the primary endosymbiont of aphids, and of several other species of endosymbiotic bacteria have shown that these species exhibit an increase in the rate of substitution of slightly deleterious mutations, among other predicted effects of increased drift due to small Ne, such as reduced codon bias. However, these studies have been limited in taxonomic scope, and it was therefore not clear whether the increase in rate is a general feature of endosymbiont lineages. Here, we test the prediction that a long-term reduction in Ne causes an increase in substitution rate using {DNA} sequences of the 16S {rRNA} gene from 13 phylogenetically independent comparisons between taxonomically diverse endosymbiotic microorganisms and their free-living relatives. Maximum likelihood and distance-based methods both indicate a significant increase in substitution rate in a wide range of bacterial and fungal endosymbionts compared to closely related free-living lineages. We use the same data set to test whether 16S genes from endosymbionts display increased A + T content, another indicator of increased genetic drift, and find that there is no significant difference in base composition between endosymbiont and nonendosymbiont 16S genes. However, analysis of an additional data set of whole bacterial genomes demonstrates that, while host-dependent bacteria have significantly increased genomic A + T content, the base content of the 16S gene tends to vary less than that of the whole genome. It is possible that selection for stability of {rRNA} is strong enough to overcome the effects of drift toward increased A + T content in endosymbiont 16S genes, despite the reduced effective population sizes of these organisms.},

This important prediction has not been widely empirically tested, largely because of the difficulty of comparing rates of molecular evolution in sufficient numbers of independent lineages which differ only in Ne. Island endemic species provide an ideal test of the effect of Ne on molecular evolution because species restricted to islands frequently have smaller Ne than closely related mainland species, and island endemics have arisen from mainland lineages many times in a wide range of taxa. We collated a dataset of 70 phylogenetically independent comparisons between island and mainland taxa, including vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, from 19 different island groups. The rate of molecular evolution in these lineages was estimated by maximum likelihood using two measures: overall substitution rate and the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates. We show that island lineages have significantly higher ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates than mainland lineages, as predicted by the nearly neutral theory, although overall substitution rates do not differ significantly. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Fitness effects of mutations fall on a continuumranging from lethal to deleterious to beneficial. The distribution of fitness effects ({DFE}) among random mutations is an essential component of every evolutionary model and a mathematical portrait of robustness. Recent experiments on five viral species all revealed a characteristic bimodal-shaped {DFE} featuring peaks at neutrality and lethality. However, the phenotypic causes underlying observed fitness effects are still unknown and presumably, are thought to vary unpredictably from one mutation to another. By combining population genetics simulations with a simple biophysical protein folding model, we show that protein thermodynamic stability accounts for a large fraction of observed mutational effects. We assume that moderately destabilizing mutations inflict a fitness penalty proportional to the reduction in folded protein, which depends continuously on folding free energy (ΔG). Most mutations in our model affect fitness by altering ΔG, whereas based on simple estimates, ∼10\% abolish activity and are unconditionally lethal. Mutations pushing ΔG {\textbackslash}textgreater 0 are also considered lethal. Contrary to neutral network theory, we find that, in mutation/selection/drift steady state, high mutation rates (m) lead to less stable proteins and a more dispersed {DFE} (i.e., less mutational robustness). Small population size (N) also decreases stability and robustness. In our model, a continuum of nonlethal mutations reduces fitness by ∼2\% on average, whereas ∼10-35\% of mutations are lethal depending on Nandm. Compensatory mutations are common in small populations with high mutation rates. More broadly, we conclude that interplay between biophysical and population genetic forces shapes the {DFE}.},

We propose that natural selection against protein-protein misinteraction, which wastes functional molecules and is potentially toxic, constrains the evolution of surface residues. Because highly expressed proteins are under stronger pressures to avoid misinteraction, surface residues are expected to show an E-R anticorrelation. Our molecular-level evolutionary simulation and yeast genomic analysis confirm multiple predictions of the hypothesis. These findings show a pluralistic origin of the E-R anticorrelation and reveal the role of protein misinteraction, an inherent property of complex cellular systems, in constraining protein evolution.},

A lineage that underwent Darwinian selection may have a nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio ({dN}/{dS}) that is different from those of other lineages or greater than one. In this paper, several codon-based likelihood models that allow for variable {dN}/{dS} ratios among lineages were developed. They were then used to construct likelihood ratio tests to examine whether the {dN}/{dS} ratio is variable among evolutionary lineages, whether the ratio for a few lineages of interest is different from the background ratio for other lineages in the phylogeny, and whether the {dN}/{dS} ratio for the lineages of interest is greater than one. The tests were applied to the lysozyme genes of 24 primate species. The {dN}/{dS} ratios were found to differ significantly among lineages, indicating that the evolution of primate lysozymes is episodic, which is incompatible with the neutral theory. Maximum-likelihood estimates of parameters suggested that about nine nonsynonymous and zero synonymous nucleotide substitutions occurred in the lineage leading to hominoids, and the {dN}/{dS} ratio for that lineage is significantly greater than one. The corresponding estimates for the lineage ancestral to colobine monkeys were nine and one, and the {dN}/{dS} ratio for the lineage is not significantly greater than one, although it is significantly higher than the background ratio. The likelihood analysis thus confirmed most, but not all, conclusions Messier and Stewart reached using reconstructed ancestral sequences to estimate synonymous and nonsynonymous rates for different lineages.},

'Empirical' models do not explicitly consider factors that shape protein evolution, but attempt to summarize the substitution pattern from large quantities of real data.

They account for features of sequence evolution, such as transition-transversion bias and base or codon frequency biases, and make use of physicochemical distances between amino acids to specify nonsynonymous substitution rates. A general approach is presented that transforms a Markov model of codon substitution into a model of amino acid replacement. Protein sequences from the entire mitochondrial genomes of 20 mammalian species were analyzed using different models. The mechanistic models were found to fit the data better than empirical models derived from large databases. Both the mutational distance between amino acids (determined by the genetic code and mutational biases such as the transition-transversion bias) and the physicochemical distance are found to have strong effects on amino acid substitution rates. A significant proportion of amino acid substitutions appeared to have involved more than one codon position, indicating that nucleotide substitutions at neighboring sites may be correlated.

Monte Carlo integration is used to integrate over the ancestral speciation times for particular trees. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to generate the set of trees with the highest posterior probabilities. Methods are described for an empirical Bayesian analysis, in which estimates of the speciation and extinction rates are used in calculating the posterior probabilities, and a hierarchical Bayesian analysis, in which these parameters are removed from the model by an additional integration. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo method avoids the requirement of our earlier method for calculating {MAP} trees to sum over all possible topologies (which limited the number of taxa in an analysis to about five). The methods are applied to analyze {DNA} sequences for nine species of primates, and the {MAP} tree, which is identical to a maximum- likelihood estimate of topology, has a probability of approximately 95\%.},

The programs can be used for (i) maximum likelihood estimation of evolutionary parameters such as branch lengths in a phylogenetic tree, the transition/transversion rate ratio, the shape parameter of the gamma distribution for variable evolutionary rates at sites, and rate parameters for different genes; (ii) likelihood ratio test of hypotheses concerning sequence evolution, such as rate constancy and independence among sites and rate constancy among lineages (the molecular clock); (iii) calculation of substitution rates at sites and reconstruction of ancestral nucleotide or amino acid sequences; and (iv) phylogenetic tree reconstruction by maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The strength of {PAML}, in comparison with other phylo-genetic packages currently available, is its implementation of a variety of evolutionary models. These include several models of variable evolutionary rates among sites, models for combined analyses of multiple gene sequence data and models for amino acid sequences. Multifurcating trees are supported, as well as trees in which some sequences are ancestral to some others. A heuristic tree search algorithm (star decomposition) is used in the package, but tree making is not a strong point of the current version, although work is under way to implement efficient search algorithms.

Previous studies that used this measure to detect positive selection have often taken an approach of pairwise comparison, estimating substitution rates by averaging over all sites in the protein. As most amino acids in a functional protein are under structural and functional constraints and adaptive evolution probably affects only a few sites at a few time points, this approach of averaging rates over sites and over time has little power. Previously, we developed codon-based substitution models that allow the \$ømega\$ ratio to vary either among lineages or among sites. In this paper we extend previous models to allow the \$ømega\$ ratio to vary both among sites and among lineages and implement the new models in the likelihood framework. These models may be useful for identifying positive selection along prespecified lineages that affects only a few sites in the protein. We apply those branch-site models as well as previous branch- and site-specific models to three data sets: the lysozyme genes from primates, the tumor suppressor {BRCA} genes from primates, and the phytochrome ({PHY}) gene family in angiosperms. Positive selection is detected in the lysozyme and {BRCA} genes by both the new and the old models. However, only the new models detected positive selection acting on lineages after gene duplication in the {PHY} gene family. Additional tests on several data sets suggest that the new models may be useful in detecting positive selection after gene duplication in gene family evolution.},

We compare the new method with maximum likelihood, as well as several other approximate methods, by examining infinitely long sequences, performing computer simulations, and analyzing a real data set. The results suggest that when there are transition/transversion rate biases and base/codon frequency biases, previously described approximate methods for estimating the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio may involve serious biases, and the bias can be both positive and negative. The new method is, in general, superior to earlier approximate methods and may be useful for analyzing large data sets, although maximum likelihood appears to always be the method of choice.},

	abstract = {Current models of codon substitution are formulated at the levels of nucleotide substitution and do not explicitly consider the separate effects of mutation and selection. They are thus incapable of inferring whether mutation or selection is responsible for evolution at silent sites. Here we implement a few population genetics models of codon substitution that explicitly consider mutation bias and natural selection at the {DNA} level. Selection on codon usage is modeled by introducing codon-fitness parameters, which together with mutation-bias parameters, predict optimal codon frequencies for the gene. The selective pressure may be for translational efficiency and accuracy or for fine-tuning translational kinetics to produce correct protein folding. We apply the models to compare mitochondrial and nuclear genes from several mammalian species. Model assumptions concerning codon usage are found to affect the estimation of sequence distances (such as the synonymous rate {dS}, the nonsynonymous rate {dN}, and the rate at the 4-fold degenerate sites d4), as found in previous studies, but the new models produced very similar estimates to some old ones. We also develop a likelihood ratio test to examine the null hypothesis that codon usage is due to mutation bias alone, not influenced by natural selection. Application of the test to the mammalian data led to rejection of the null hypothesis in most genes, suggesting that natural selection may be a driving force in the evolution of synonymous codon usage in mammals. Estimates of selection coefficients nevertheless suggest that selection on codon usage is weak and most mutations are nearly neutral. The sensitivity of the analysis on the assumed mutation model is discussed.},

A codon-substitution model was assumed, which accounts for the genetic code structure, transition/transversion bias, and base frequency biases at codon positions. Likelihood ratio tests were applied to test the constancy of nonsynonymous to synonymous rate ratios among branches (evolutionary lineages). It is found that at 22 of the 48 nuclear loci examined, the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio varies significantly across branches of the tree. The result provides strong evidence against a strictly neutral model of molecular evolution. Our likelihood estimates of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates differ considerably from previous results obtained from approximate pairwise sequence comparisons. The differences between the methods are explored by detailed analyses of data from several genes. Transition/transversion rate bias and codon frequency biases are found to have significant effects on the estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates, and approximate methods do not adequately account for those factors. The likelihood approach is preferable, even for pairwise sequence comparison, because more realistic models about the mutation and substitution processes can be incorporated in the analysis.},

Maximum likelihood models of codon substitution developed recently account for variable selective pressures among amino acid sites by employing a statistical distribution for the w ratio among sites. Those models, called random-sites models, are suitable when we do not know a priori which sites are under what kind of selective pressure. Sometimes prior information (such as the tertiary structure of the protein) might be available to partition sites in the protein into different classes, which are expected to be under different selective pressures. It is then sensible to use such information in the model. In this paper, we implement maximum likelihood models for prepartitioned data sets, which account for the heterogeneity among site partitions by using different w parameters for the partitions. The models, referred to as fixed-sites models, are also useful for combined analysis of multiple genes from the same set of species. We apply the models to data sets of the major histocompatibility complex ({MHC}) class I alleles from human populations and of the abalone sperm lysin genes. Structural information is used to partition sites in {MHC} into two classes: those in the antigen recognition site ({ARS}) and those outside. Positive selection is detected in the {ARS} by the fixed-sites models. Similarly, sites in lysin are classified into the buried and solvent-exposed classes according to the tertiary structure, and positive selection was detected at the solvent-exposed sites. The random-sites models identified a number of sites under positive selection in each data set, confirming and elaborating the results of the fixed-sites models. The analysis demonstrates the utility of the fixed-sites models, as well as the power of previous random-sites models, which do not use the prior information to partition sites.},

	abstract = {Codon-based substitution models have been widely used to identify amino acid sites under positive selection in comparative analysis of protein-coding {DNA} sequences. The nonsynonymous-synonymous substitution rate ratio (d N/{dS}, denoted \$ømega\$) is used as a measure of selective pressure at the protein level, with \$ømega\$ {\textbackslash}textgreater 1 indicating positive selection. Statistical distributions are used to model the variation in \$ømega\$ among sites, allowing a subset of sites to have \$ømega\$ {\textbackslash}textgreater 1 while the rest of the sequence may be under purifying selection with \$ømega\$ {\textbackslash}textless 1. An empirical Bayes ({EB}) approach is then used to calculate posterior probabilities that a site comes from the site class with \$ømega\$ {\textbackslash}textgreater 1. Current implementations, however, use the naive {EB} ({NEB}) approach and fail to account for sampling errors in maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters, such as the proportions and \$ømega\$ ratios for the site classes. In small data sets lacking information, this approach may lead to unreliable posterior probability calculations. In this paper, we develop a Bayes empirical Bayes ({BEB}) approach to the problem, which assigns a prior to the model parameters and integrates over their uncertainties. We compare the new and old methods on real and simulated data sets. The results suggest that in small data sets the new {BEB} method does not generate false positives as did the old {NEB} approach, while in large data sets it retains the good power of the {NEB} approach for inferring positively selected sites. © Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution 2005; all rights reserved.},

We show that current models used to estimate \$ømega\$ are substantially biased by naturally occurring sequence compositions. We present a novel model that weights substitutions by conditional nucleotide frequencies and which escapes these artifacts. Applying it to the genomes of pathogens causing malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, and Lyme disease gave significant discrepancies in estimates with ∼10-30\% of genes affected.

Recent research assumes that {RSA} is the main determinant of sequence divergence. However, it is not yet clear which is the best predictor of substitution rates. To address this issue, we compared {RSA} and {LPD} with site-specific rates of evolution for a diverse data set of enzymes. In contrast with recent studies, we found that {LPD} measures correlate better than {RSA} with evolutionary rate. Moreover, the independent contribution of {RSA} is minor. Taking into account that {LPD} is related to backbone flexibility, we put forward the possibility that the rate of evolution of a site is determined by the ease with which the backbone deforms to accommodate mutations.},

Both the nucleotide and the amino acid sequences were analyzed, producing conflicting results. The global molecular clock was clearly violated for both the nucleotide and the amino acid data. Models of local clocks were implemented using maximum likelihood, allowing different evolutionary rates for some lineages while assuming rate constancy in others. Surprisingly, the highly divergent third codon positions appeared to contain phylogenetic information and produced more sensible estimates of primate divergence dates than did the amino acid sequences. Estimated dates varied considerably depending on the data type, the calibration point, and the substitution model but differed little among the four tree topologies used. We conclude that the calibration derived from the primate fossil record is too recent to be reliable; we also point out a number of problems in date estimation when the molecular clock does not hold. Despite these obstacles, we derived estimates of primate divergence dates that were well supported by the data and were generally consistent with the paleontological record. Estimation of the mouse-rat divergence date, however, was problematic.},

	abstract = {Do interactions between residues in a protein (i.e. epistasis) significantly alter evolutionary dynamics? If so, what consequences might they have on inference from traditional codon substitution models which assume site-independence for the sake of computational tractability? To investigate the effects of epistasis on substitution rates, we employed a mechanistic mutation-selection model in conjunction with a fitness framework derived from protein stability. We refer to this as the stability-informed site-dependent (S-{SD}) model, and developed a new stability-informed site-independent (S-{SI}) model that captures the average effect of stability constraints on individual sites of a protein. Comparison of S-{SI} and S-{SD} offers a novel and direct method for investigating the consequences of stability-induced epistasis on protein evolution. We developed S-{SI} and S-{SD} models for three natural proteins and showed that they generate sequences consistent with real alignments. Our analyses revealed that epistasis tends to increase substitution rates compared to the rates under site-independent evolution. We then assessed the epistatic sensitivity of individual site and discovered a counterintuitive effect: highly connected sites were less influenced by epistasis relative to exposed sites. Lastly, we show that, despite the unrealistic assumptions, traditional models perform comparably well in the presence and absence of epistasis, and provide reasonable summaries of average selection intensities. We conclude that epistatic models are critical to understanding protein evolutionary dynamics, but epistasis might not be required for reasonable inference of selection pressure when averaging over time and sites.},

	abstract = {Classical population genetics a priori assigns fitness to alleles without considering molecular or functional properties of proteins that these alleles encode. Here we study population dynamics in a model where fitness can be inferred from physical properties of proteins under a physiological assumption that loss of stability of any protein encoded by an essential gene confers a lethal phenotype. Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Γ genes can then be represented as diffusion within the Γ-dimensional hypercube with adsorbing boundaries determined, in each dimension, by loss of a protein's stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences. Solving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on point mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein stabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental relation between mutation rate, maximal genome size, and thermodynamic response of proteins to point mutations. It establishes a universal speed limit on rate of molecular evolution by predicting that populations go extinct (via lethal mutagenesis) when mutation rate exceeds approximately six mutations per essential part of genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and one to two mutations per genome per replication for thermophilic ones. Several {RNA} viruses function close to the evolutionary speed limit, whereas error correction mechanisms used by {DNA} viruses and nonmutant strains of bacteria featuring various genome lengths and mutation rates have brought these organisms universally ≈1,000-fold below the natural speed limit. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA}.},

These studies found that the evolutionary rate of a protein is predominantly influenced by its expression level rather than functional importance.

Here we show how the need to minimize the waste of resources to non-functional interactions limits the proteome diversity and the average concentration of co-expressed and co-localized proteins. Using the results of high-throughput Yeast 2-Hybrid experiments, we estimate the characteristic strength of non-functional protein-protein interactions. By combining these data with the strengths of specific interactions, we assess the fraction of time proteins spend tied up in non-functional interactions as a function of their overall concentration. This allows us to sketch the phase diagram for baker's yeast cells using the experimentally measured concentrations and subcellular localization of their proteins. The positions of yeast compartments on the phase diagram are consistent with our hypothesis that the yeast proteome has evolved to operate closely to the upper limit of its size, whereas keeping individual protein concentrations sufficiently low to reduce non-functional interactions. These findings have implication for conceptual understanding of intracellular compartmentalization, multicellularity and differentiation. © 2008 {EMBO} and Nature Publishing Group.},

However, testing these relations is not straightforward, owing to the difficulty in estimating Ne. Here, we introduce an integrative framework allowing for an explicit reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of Ne, thus leading to a quantitative test of the nearly neutral theory and an estimation of the allometric scaling of the ratios of nonsynonymous over synonymous polymorphism (πN/πS) and divergence ({dN}/{dS}) with respect to Ne. As an illustration, we applied our method to primates, for which the nearly neutral predictions were mostly verified. Under a purely nearly neutral model with a constant {DFE} across species, we find that the variation in πN/πS and {dN}/{dS} as a function of Ne is too large to be compatible with current estimates of the {DFE} based on site frequency spectra. The reconstructed history of Ne shows a 10-fold variation across primates. The mutation rate per generation u, also reconstructed over the tree by the method, varies over a 3-fold range and is negatively correlated with Ne. As a result of these opposing trends for Ne and u, variation in πS is intermediate, primarily driven by Ne but substantially influenced by u. Altogether, our integrative framework provides a quantitative assessment of the role of Ne and u in modulating patterns of genetic variation, while giving a synthetic picture of their history over the clade.},

We develop a {McDonald}–Kreitman-based method to infer adaptation rate and strength, and estimate α = 0.135 in human protein-coding sequences, 72\% of which is contributed by weakly adaptive variants. We show that, in this adaptation regime, α is reduced {\textasciitilde}25\% by linkage genome-wide. Moreover, we show that virus-interacting proteins undergo adaptation that is both stronger and nearly twice as frequent as the genome average (α = 0.224, 56\% due to strongly beneficial alleles). Our results suggest that, while most adaptation in human proteins is weakly beneficial, adaptation to viruses is often strongly beneficial. Our method provides a robust framework for estimation of adaptation rate and strength across species.},

	abstract = {In Drosophila and humans, there are accumulating examples of loci with a significant excess of high-frequency-derived alleles or high levels of linkage disequilibrium, relative to a neutral model of a random-mating population of constant size. These are features expected after a recent selective sweep. Their prevalence suggests that positive directional selection may be widespread in both species. However, as I show here, these features do not persist long after the sweep ends: The high-frequency alleles drift to fixation and no longer contribute to polymorphism, while linkage disequilibrium is broken down by recombination. As a result, loci chosen without independent evidence of recent selection are not expected to exhibit either of these features, even if they have been affected by numerous sweeps in their genealogical history. How then can we explain the patterns in the data? One possibility is population structure, with unequal sampling from different subpopulations. Alternatively, positive selection may not operate as is commonly modeled. In particular, the rate of fixation of advantageous mutations may have increased in the recent past.},

Four functional mutational categories are considered: silent and replacement substitutions in the transmembrane portion of the {COII} molecule, and silent and replacement substitutions in the cytosolic portion. Three tree topological mutational categories are used: intraspecific tips, intraspecific interiors, and interspecific fixed mutations. A full contingency analysis is performed, followed by nested contingency analyses. The analyses indicate that replacement mutations in the cytosolic portion are deleterious, and replacement mutations in the transmembrane portion and silent mutations throughout tend to be neutral. These conclusions are robust to ambiguities in tree topology and branch lengths. These inferences would have been impossible with an analysis that only contrasts silent and replacement vs. polymorphic and fixed. Also, intraspecific interior mutations have similar evolutionary dynamics to fixed mutations, so pooling tip and interior mutations into a single “polymorphic” class reduces power. Finally, the detected deleterious selection causes lowered inbreeding effective sizes, so arguments for small effective sizes in recent human evolutionary history based upon mitochondrial {DNA} may be invalid.},

We find that in the presence of slightly deleterious mutations, {MK} estimates of α severely underestimate the true rate of adaptation even if all polymorphisms with population frequencies under 50\% are excluded. Furthermore, already under intermediate rates of adaptation, genetic draft substantially distorts the site frequency spectra at neutral and functional sites from the expectations under mutation–selection–drift balance. {MK}-type approaches that first infer demography from synonymous sites and then use the inferred demography to correct the estimation of α obtain almost the correct α in our simulations. However, these approaches typically infer a severe past population expansion although there was no such expansion in the simulations, casting doubt on the accuracy of methods that infer demography from synonymous polymorphism data. We propose a simple asymptotic extension of the {MK} test that yields accurate estimates of α in our simulations and should provide a fruitful direction for future studies.},

In their current form, mutation–selection codon models are entirely characterized by the collection of site-specific amino-acid fitness profiles. However, thus far, they have relied on the assumption of a constant genetic drift, translating into a unique effective population size (Ne) across the phylogeny, clearly an unrealistic assumption. This assumption can be alleviated by introducing variation in Ne between lineages. In addition to Ne, the mutation rate (μ) is susceptible to vary between lineages, and both should covary with life-history traits ({LHTs}). This suggests that the model should more globally account for the joint evolutionary process followed by all of these lineage-specific variables (Ne, μ, and {LHTs}). In this direction, we introduce an extended mutation–selection model jointly reconstructing in a Bayesian Monte Carlo framework the fitness landscape across sites and long-term trends in Ne, μ, and {LHTs} along the phylogeny, from an alignment of {DNA} coding sequences and a matrix of observed {LHTs} in extant species. The model was tested against simulated data and applied to empirical data in mammals, isopods, and primates. The reconstructed history of Ne in these groups appears to correlate with {LHTs} or ecological variables in a way that suggests that the reconstruction is reasonable, at least in its global trends. On the other hand, the range of variation in Ne inferred across species is surprisingly narrow.

	abstract = {Molecular sequences are shaped by selection, where the strength of selection relative to drift is determined by effective population size (Ne). Populations with high Ne are expected to undergo stronger purifying selection, and consequently to show a lower substitution rate for selected mutations relative to the substitution rate for neutral mutations (ω). However, computational models based on biophysics of protein stability have suggested that ω can also be independent of Ne. Together, the response of ω to changes in Ne depends on the specific mapping from sequence to fitness. Importantly, an increase in protein expression level has been found empirically to result in decrease of ω, an observation predicted by theoretical models assuming selection for protein stability. Here, we derive a theoretical approximation for the response of ω to changes in Ne and expression level, under an explicit genotype-phenotype-fitness map. The method is generally valid for additive traits and log-concave fitness functions. We applied these results to protein undergoing selection for their conformational stability and corroborate out findings with simulations under more complex models. We predict a weak response of ω to changes in either Ne or expression level, which are interchangeable. Based on empirical data, we propose that fitness based on the conformational stability may not be a sufficient mechanism to explain the empirically observed variation in ω across species. Other aspects of protein biophysics might be explored, such as protein–protein interactions, which can lead to a stronger response of ω to changes in Ne.},

	abstract = {There is a large literature in the last two decades affirming adaptive {DNA} sequences evolution between species. The main lines of evidence are from i) the {McDonald}-Kreitman ({MK}) test, which compares divergence and polymorphism data, and ii) the {PAML} test, which analyzes multi-species divergence data. Here, we apply these two tests concurrently on the genomic data of Drosophila and Arabidopsis. To our surprise, the \&gt;100 genes identified by the two tests do not overlap beyond random expectation. Because the non-concordance could be due to low powers leading to high false-negatives, we merge every 20 - 30 genes into a “supergene”. At the supergene level, the power of detection is large but the calls still do not overlap. We rule out methodological reasons for the non-concordance. In particular, extensive simulations fail to find scenarios whereby positive selection can only be detected by either {MK} or {PAML}, but not both. Since molecular evolution is governed by positive and negative selection concurrently, a fundamental assumption for estimating one (say, positive selection) is that the other is constant. However, in a broad survey of primates, birds, Drosophila and Arabidopsis, we found that negative selection rarely stays constant for long in evolution. As a consequence, the variation in negative selection is often mis-construed as signal of positive selection. In conclusion, {MK}, {PAML} or any method that examines genomic sequence evolution has to explicitly address the variation in negative selection before estimating positive selection. In a companion study, we propose a possible path forward in two stages – first, by mapping out the changes in negative selection and then using this map to estimate positive selection. For now, the large literature on positive selection between species has to await the re-assessment.},

It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations σ1 and σ2, it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the “percentage of causation,” which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.},

Whether codon usage is also generally shaped by natural selection in large organisms, despite their relatively small effective population size (Ne), is unclear. In animals, the population genetics of codon usage bias has only been studied in a handful of model organisms so far, and can be affected by confounding, nonadaptive processes such as {GC}-biased gene conversion and experimental artefacts. Using population transcriptomics data, we analyzed the relationship between codon usage, gene expression, allele frequency distribution, and recombination rate in 30 nonmodel species of animals, each from a different family, covering a wide range of effective population sizes. We disentangled the effects of translational selection and {GC}-biased gene conversion on codon usage by separately analyzing {GC}-conservative and {GC}-changing mutations. We report evidence for effective translational selection on codon usage in large-Ne species of animals, but not in small-Ne ones, in agreement with the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. C- and T-ending codons tend to be preferred over synonymous G- and A-ending ones, for reasons that remain to be determined. In contrast, we uncovered a conspicuous effect of {GC}-biased gene conversion, which is widespread in animals and the main force determining the fate of {AT}\${\textbackslash}leftrightarrow\${GC} mutations. Intriguingly, the strength of its effect was uncorrelated with Ne.},

Particularly, the recent outburst of {DNA} sequence data lends strong support to the theory both with respect to evolutionary base substitutions and {DNA} polymorphism, including rapid evolutionary base substitutions in pseudogenes.

The aggregate effect of substitution on neutral polymorphism is estimated; in populations of total size 106 or more (and perhaps of 104 or more), this effect will be more important than that of random fixation. This may explain why the extent of polymorphism in natural populations does not vary as much as one would expect from a consideration of the equilibrium between mutation and random fixation in populations of different sizes. For a selectively maintained polymorphism at a linked locus, this process will only be important in the long run if it leads to complete fixation. If the selective coefficients at the linked locus are small compared to those at the substituted locus, it is shown that the probability of complete fixation at the linked locus is approximately exp (- Nc), where c is the recombinant fraction and N the population size.
